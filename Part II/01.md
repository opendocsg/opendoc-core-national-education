# US-China Trade Conflict: Implications for Singapore

## Key Messages

- As a small, open economy, Singapore relies heavily on trade to survive and grow. Total trade accounts for more than three times our Gross Domestic Product (GDP). 

- We support a rules-based multilateral trading system, i.e., the World Trade Organisation (WTO), that promotes free trade and open markets.

- Since the end of World War II, this system has delivered peace, stability and prosperity to many countries around the world, including Singapore. 

- It is important for Singapore, as a global hub, that there continues to be free trade and open markets.  

1. In 2018, the United States (US) imposed tariffs on worldwide imports of solar panels and washing machines to safeguard its domestic industries. Subsequently, it invoked steel and aluminium tariffs based on national security reasons. These moves triggered retaliatory measures from the US’ major trading partners such as the European Union (EU), Canada and Mexico. In particular, China was targeted by US trade actions that purported to address “unfair” Chinese trade practices, such as the expropriation of US intellectual property and imposition of stringent restrictions on US investment in China.

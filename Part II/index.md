# Part II: Economy

1\. Surviving our independence  

When Singapore separated from Malaysia in 1965, we had to find ways to survive. We lost our hinterland and we had no natural resources. Strikes and industrial unrest were common in Singapore. Our circumstances worsened in 1968, when the British military announced their withdrawal from Singapore by 1971. Thousands would lose their jobs and a fifth of our nascent economy would be at risk of coming to a halt. To survive as a young country, our leaders had to build the economy by creating favourable conditions for attracting investments and create jobs for our people from scratch.

2\. Growing our economy

As a small and open economy, we are dependent on free trade to survive and prosper. Total trade accounts for more than three times our Gross Domestic Product (GDP). We continue to support a rules-based multilateral trading system, i.e., the World Trade Organisation (WTO) which promotes free trade and open markets. At the same time, we work with like-minded partners to establish an extensive network of free trade agreements (FTAs) and on regional economic integration that would maximise opportunities for Singaporeâ€™s businesses and create jobs for our people. Starting with the FTA with New Zealand in 1999, we now have 24 implemented FTAs and Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with 36 trading partners globally. To facilitate trade and ensure open connectivity with the rest of the world, we built maritime ports and Changi Airport which over time, had gained world-class status.

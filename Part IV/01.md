# Part IV: Infrastructure

# Building from scratch

Living conditions were poor in the early days of independence. Singapore inherited problems that confronted many young nations, including a critical shortage of housing – about one-third of our population were living in rented sleeping cubicles or crowded squatter settlements (i.e. average of 18.2 persons living in same house) without proper sanitation, water or basic amenities. Following separation from Malaysia in 1965, our founding leaders needed to address the people’s basic needs quickly, such as housing, security, utilities, water and waste management infrastructure, taking into consideration our land constraints and lack of natural resources.

On 18 November, Minister for Trade and Industry Mr Chan Chun Sing said that many Singaporeans had asked if the clashes in Hong Kong (HK) and elsewhere could happen here. He drew these lessons for Singapore:

* **Political systems and culture**. Political systems should find concrete ways for diverse interests to co-exist, to improve the lives of people and enable them to fulfil their aspirations. Leaders should put the interests of their people and country first.
* **Long-term policy making**. The success of governments was determined by their abilities to enable the next generation to do better than the current, beyond the mere short term. This would require the leaders to consider the future and external environment, in addition to existing domestic issues.
* **Social cohesion and conflict resolution**. Dialogue and constructive actions must be the Singapore way to resolve problems, with everyone playing a part to take action in responsible ways. A winner-takes-all mentality, insistence on maximal individual gains at the expense of the collective good, and violent means should not be the way.
* **Relevance of small city-states**. Singapore had to survive and thrive even without a conventional hinterland. Our continued relevance to the world was not a given. A small city-state like Singapore must work hard to chart our own destiny, distinguish ourselves and stay exceptional amidst the global uncertainties.

> *"Conflict resolution is not about telling the government what we want, and have others solve the problem for us. It is about all of us coming together to tackle the issues together. This is the true meaning of the democracy of deeds.” * <br> - Minister for Trade and Industry Mr Chan Chun Sing

### “People versus Police” Situation
During [remarks to Home Team officers on 30 September](https://www.mha.gov.sg/newsroom/speeches/news/minister-awards-presentation-ceremony-2019-opening-remarks-by-mr-k-shanmugam-minister-for-home-affairs-and-minister-for-law), Minister for Home Affairs and Law Mr K Shanmugam underlined the importance of not taking the high public trust in our Home Team officers for granted.

Mr Shanmugam said that the severely strained relationship between the police and the people in HK was due to the many different narratives propagated by local, foreign and social media. Most of these narratives were one-sided and portrayed the police in a negative light. He highlighted several key lessons:

Internal agencies, including the Home Team, were not the solution for problems stemming from politics and fundamental socio-economic issues.

The responsibility to get the basic issues right in society lay with the government. This had to be clearly communicated to the public. It was important to keep the public fully informed of happenings in the country.

### The HK Protests

The mass protests in HK were first sparked by the government’s extradition bill, which would have allowed HK to transfer suspects to jurisdictions with which it did not have an extradition agreement, including mainland China. The move was widely viewed as a process Beijing could use to increase its control of HK. The HK society had also become deeply polarised, over domestic issues like expensive housing and a widening wealth gap.

Here is a timeline of key events:

## 2. Asean and its Role in the World

At the 6th ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting (ADMM) Retreat and the 6th ADMM-Plus (which includes Defence Ministers from Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, Korea, Russia and the United States) in November, the Defence Ministers acknowledged the need for deeper collaboration to address security challenges, and reaffirmed their commitment towards regional peace, security and stability.

### Enhancing Cooperation in the South China Sea
Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen spoke about the importance of finding ways to build confidence among countries, such as through the recent ASEAN-US and ASEAN-China maritime exercises. He highlighted that the ADMM-Plus countries needed to communicate with each other despite differences, in the current climate of tensions and potential conflict in the South China Sea.

The Code of Conduct (COC) for the South China Sea would also be an important step in resolving the frictions between China and the US. While Dr Ng would not describe the situation over the South China Sea as tense, he said that there was potential for accidents or incidents to occur, which was what the COC tried to prevent. With more lines for communication, the risks of miscalculation would be reduced.

### Outcomes
The ADMM-Plus released a Joint Statement on Advancing Partnership for Sustainable Security; in it, they pledged to maintain peace and stability in the region by respecting international law and promoting cooperation. They also upheld the significance of the ADMM-Plus as a key component of a “robust, effective and open regional security arrangement” that built confidence and trust, as well as defence and security cooperation between ASEAN and Plus countries.

In addition to the ADMM Retreat and ADMM-Plus, informal meetings were held between the ASEAN Defence Ministers and representatives from China, the United States and Japan. Through these meetings, China and the US reaffirmed their cooperation with ASEAN for the defence and peace of the region.

On 17 November, Dr Ng also had several meetings with his counterparts, including Australian Minister of Defence Linda Reynolds, Indonesian Defence Minister Prabowo Subianto, Japanese Minister of Defence Taro Kono, and Thailand Deputy Prime Minister General Prawit Wongsuwan, to reaffirm warm and friendly bilateral relations.
> "*We share the same perspective, that Indonesia and Singapore have many areas where we can work together for mutual benefit while helping each other resolve differences that inevitably crop up from time to time among close neighbours.” *– Dr Ng on his meeting with Mr Subianto

## 3. SINGAPORE-US DEFENCE RELATIONS
In December, Dr Ng attended the 7th Reagan National Defense Forum in the US, where he spoke about the strong, mutually beneficial defence relationship between Singapore and the US, and the similarities our two countries shared.

* An openness to diverse ideas and people in our quest to form a united and strong country.
* Our efforts to build a global system based on the principles of multilateralism, free trade and rule of law.
* A shared partnership to deal with transnational challenges such as terrorism and climate change.

Dr Ng and US Secretary of Defence Mark Esper also signed a Memorandum of Understanding for Singapore to set up a fighter aircraft training detachment at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. The new training airspace at Guam would provide the RSAF with more opportunities to conduct realistic training. The RSAF’s overseas training spaces and detachments allowed the RSAF to overcome the constraints of our small local airspace and maintain its readiness.

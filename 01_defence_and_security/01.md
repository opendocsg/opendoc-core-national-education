# Our Fundamentals

**Build our own defence**

Singapore’s vulnerabilities have remained unchanged. We are a small city-state with a Chinese-majority population, organised around the principle of multicultural meritocracy. Our small size and geographical location leaves us with no strategic depth or hinterland to fall back on if we are attacked. We need to build a strong and credible defence force to protect our sovereignty and our national interests, for our survival.


**Safeguard freedom of access by land, air and sea **

As a small country with no natural resources, we are dependent on free trade and open markets around the world. We therefore have a strong interest in ensuring our land, air and sea lanes remain open and safe, so that ships and aircraft can move freely into and from Singapore.

 
**Strengthen international relations **

A stable and peaceful international and regional environment, based on a rules-based order, is essential for Singapore’s survival, security and progress. We live in an uncertain security environment. A rules-based world order benefits all countries as it is predictable and allows countries to manage diplomatic relations and issues based on agreed principles. This, in turn, assures that countries, no matter big or small, will have their interests taken into account. Backed by the SAF, we are able to stand firm and have a “place at the table”, giving us the political space to pursue policies that are in our national interests.

 

**Secure our homeland **

Racial and religious harmony underpins our national cohesion and unity. Our resilience and unity will brace us against security challenges that are constantly evolving. The hybrid threats that we face today are complex and multi-faceted. These threats have gone beyond the physical domain into the digital domain. They target the hearts and minds of Singaporeans, and are aimed at breaking our social unity and resilience. It now takes more than our security authorities alone to deal with these new challenges. Regardless of race or religion, we can all play a part to keep Singapore strong and united by being more aware of the threats, more understanding and always looking out for one another.

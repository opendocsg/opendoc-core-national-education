## Konfrontasi (1963 - 1966)

In the first two years of our independence, we had no defence to speak of. The Malaysians tried to show us that they were still in charge of our army. This brought home the realisation that being a sovereign country without the ability to defend ourselves was meaningless. Building up our own defence and homefront security forces, the SAF and the Home Team, became our top priority, hastened by the impending British withdrawal in 1971.

Indonesia started the low-intensity conflict known as Konfrontasi under the leadership of President Sukarno, from 1963 to 1966 in opposition of the formation of the Federation of Malaysia which was established on 16 September 1963, comprising Malaya, Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak. During the conflict, Indonesia carried out more than 40 bomb attacks in Singapore. Amongst these, the MacDonald House bombing on 10 March 1965 was the most serious incident in Singapore.

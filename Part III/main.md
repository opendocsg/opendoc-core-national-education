## Building a Multiracial Singapore

In the early days, Singapore comprised immigrants from different parts of the world. The various races stuck to their own enclaves and there were minimal interactions amongst them. One of the main reasons Singapore separated from Malaysia in 1965 was that while Singaporean leaders championed a “Malaysian Malaysia”, the Malaysian leaders wanted a Malay Malaysia. Following independence, our leaders were determined to build a Singapore for Singaporeans – regardless of race, language or religion. As a Chinese-majority country, we had to tread carefully in a Muslim-dominated region and handle matters of race and religion carefully. But one way or another, our leaders knew that it was important to unite all Singaporeans as one nation.

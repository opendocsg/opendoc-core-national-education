# Resource Constraints and Challenges

In September 2016, Singapore suffered one of its worst droughts in history. Barely any rain fell over 27 days between January and February -- a record high. Once verdant grass turned brown and white, and our island was suffused with heat. 


The situation was dire due to the fast depleting water levels at Johor’s Liggiu Reservoir, Singapore’s main water source from Malaysia.  At one point, water levels fell to as low as 20 per cent. Singapore still relies heavily on Johor for its water needs. Under the 1962 Water Agreement with the Johor State government, Singapore draws up to 250 million gallons of water from the catchment area daily. The prolonged drought signalled a real possibility that Singapore’s water supply could be badly affected. Singapore drew up contingency plans to restrict water use for non-critical activities such as plant watering and car washing.

Fortunately, there was no need to put these plans into effect. Decades of long-term planning and diversifying our water sources meant that we could rely on other avenues. Desalination and NEWater plants ran at high capacity to replenish the local reservoirs. The Government also raised public awareness by encouraging everyone to save water.

It was a stark reminder of Singapore’s vulnerability as a small island with a lack of natural resources. However, it was also a reflection of how we have turned this weakness into a strength. The water story is just one point in the larger story of how we have managed our lack of natural resources over the decades.

These are reasons why there has been no need for water rationing in Singapore since 1964. Water has always been a strategic and existential issue for us. As we are one of the most water-stressed countries globally, Singapore always looks to stay one step ahead to ensure our water security. We aim to become self-sufficient by 2061, when the 1962 Water Agreement expires. 

After Singapore separated from Malaysia, the challenges were clear. The absence of a hinterland meant a lack of access to vital natural resources. We would have to rely on external sources for our water supply and energy to power our industries, light up our homes, and build infrastructure. The situation was so dire that when Singapore separated from Malaysia in 1965, our founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew described Singapore as “a heart without the body”.

For Singapore to survive, one of the first things that Mr Lee and his team did was obtain the necessary resources and ensure that they would last for generations. For Singapore to succeed, planning for our resource use had to be long-term, focused, and dynamic. 

But it was clear from the start that success was not only going to be decided by government policy. Singaporeans had to play a role in the efforts. Indeed, we have gradually become active participants in water-saving campaigns. This collective sense of civic responsibility has helped us effectively manage our limited resources.

Singapore has come a long way in addressing our resource limitations. As a tiny island state with no natural resources, we have had to rely on a disciplined approach focused on four key pillars to manage our constraints: innovation, long-term planning, civic ownership and adaptation.

## Resource Innovation 

With a tiny landmass lacking in any natural resources, Singapore is unlike any other country in the world. There was no blueprint for success that Singapore could follow.  

As a result, we had to think unconventionally and summon up a spirit of innovation to solve our unique problems, especially when dealing with the lack of resources. 

### Example: Water

NEWater – reclaimed water purified with membrane and ultraviolet technologies –  is perhaps Singapore’s most famous example of this innovative spirit. The idea of turning wastewater into drinkable water emerged as early as the 1970s when Singapore commissioned a study to explore the feasibility of producing clean reclaimed water.  

However, it was only 20 years later when technology caught up with the idea that NEWater became a reality. By the 1990s, the development of cost-effective membrane technology allowed Singapore to push ahead with NEWater. Within a decade, our dogged determination paid off. In 2003, NEWater made its public debut with two plants at Bedok and Kranji. After decades of planning and innovation, it was a huge step towards our goal of self-sufficiency. 

There was initial scepticism that NEWater was safe to drink. Many balked at the thought of drinking waste and sewage water. In response, PUB set out to raise public awareness of the stringent safety measures in producing the ultra-clean NEWater.

To instil confidence in NEWater, PUB opened up its NEWater plants to the public, demonstrating the technology behind the product. To further convince the public that the water was safe to drink, Singapore enlisted the support of community leaders, scientists and politicians to correct misconceptions about NEWater. Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong himself drank a bottle in front of the nation in a NEWater toast during the 2002 National Day Parade.

Thinking out of the box is one way we have adapted. This innovative energy is a key theme that runs throughout our short history. Another area that we have consistently applied innovative thinking is in our approach to energy resources.

## Thinking Long-Term

Thinking long-term has always been a crucial part of Singapore’s planning. This helps identify problems that could arise in the future, which allows policymakers take mitigating steps beforehand. As a result of our constant and consistent effort to think ahead, Singapore has maintained sustained economic growth and infrastructure development despite our lack of natural resources. 

When we underwent a rapid industrialisation process from the 1960s to the 1980s, Singapore ensured that its energy infrastructure could always serve commercial, industrial, and residential needs. 

For instance, PUB worked closely with the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), the Economic Development Board (EDB) and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) of Singapore to estimate the power demand based on development plans and economic growth projections. Together, they formulated Long-term Power Station Development Plans that oversaw the construction of new power construction over a 10-20 year horizon.

### Example: Water

Long-term planning is critical in managing water resources in Singapore. This resource is often a source of tension between Singapore and Malaysia. In 1998, Malaysia raised supplying water to Singapore when Singapore decided to relocate Malaysia’s immigration and customs checkpoint from the old Tanjong Pagar railway station to Woodlands Train Checkpoint. In 2018, then-Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed sought to renegotiate the price of water sold to Singapore, criticising it as “manifestly ridiculous”.  

Part of our efforts to navigate the thorny water issue includes diversifying our water sources and reducing our reliance on water from Malaysian sources.

Singapore’s approach to building water resilience for the long haul started in 1971 with the Water Planning Unit’s formation, which searched for conventional and unconventional water sources. The unit formulated the first Water Master Plan in 1972, which proposed a diversified water supply that would meet future water and development needs for the next 50 years -- the Four National Taps.

## Civic Ownership

Singaporeans play a critical role in ensuring that our limited resources are carefully managed. Campaigns are important tools that help create awareness among Singaporeans of our challenges and how we can help.

These campaigns have helped reduce Singaporeans’ water usage in recent years.

To be more resource-efficient, Singapore has also targeted a Zero Waste goal. This includes being resource-resilient, a move that would always ensure a secure supply of critical resources. The effort will involve everyone, from industrial companies to individual households. 

As part of this effort, Singapore is establishing a circular economy that will eliminate waste and maximise the value of resources through recycling and reusing waste materials. The construction industry is already implementing this, where about 99 per cent of construction waste and metals are recycled for new projects.  This push has reduced the country’s dependency on sand.

Increasing energy efficiency is also another way to be resource resilient. The Energy Conservation Act implemented in 2013 now requires large energy consumers like industrial companies to adopt good energy management practices. Regular energy audits, establishing energy management systems, and energy efficiency improvement plans are necessary measures. 

Households can also play their part in reducing energy use. In addition to this ‘Zero Waste’ movement, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has launched a “Save Energy Save Money” campaign to raise awareness on energy-efficient measures by encouraging Singaporeans to practise simple energy-saving habits.

## Adapting to Changes 

Although much has been achieved since independence, certain things will remain the same: Singapore will always be a small country in an uncertain world with no natural resources. This will always continue to present challenges for us.

While we have made significant strides in tackling our water scarcity problem, we now have to confront climate change as well. As a low-lying island nation, Singapore is particularly vulnerable to the threat of rising sea levels – one that will threaten the country’s very existence.

We are already feeling the impact. In 2019, a report found that Southeast Asia would be hardest hit by rising sea levels due to melting ice sheets, as over 450 million people in the region live in low coastal zones. 

With 30 per cent of the island less than five metres above sea level, Singapore will be badly affected should sea levels continue to rise. The Centre of Climate Research Singapore has found that in the rare event of higher sea levels, high tides, and a storm happening concurrently, sea levels could rise by four metres and swamp Singapore’s coastal areas.

Tackling such a formidable challenge requires all of us to start acting now to prevent further damage to the environment. Mitigating climate change requires everyone to do their part by reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions.

For instance, we are changing our physical and urban environment to mitigate potential flood risks. This includes deepening and widening drains and protecting critical infrastructure. We are also rethinking how buildings can stay cool without the use of energy-intensive air-conditioners. This includes changing the layouts of facilities to ensure better ventilation and increasing vegetation cover across the island.

We are also progressively strengthening our defences against rising sea levels through the use of reclaimed land. Singapore is exploring the option of reclaiming a series of islands from Marina East to Changi. By connecting them with a barrage to create a bulwark, it will be one way that the country can adapt to rising sea levels. 

But land reclamation is both expensive and challenging to do, especially since it requires large quantities of sand – a resource that Singapore does not have a large abundance of.

## Conclusion

Coping with resource scarcity has been a constant challenge since Singapore was founded as an independent nation. But we have managed to navigate the challenge through a combination of innovation, long-term planning, and adaption, working collectively as a nation to ensure that Singapore stays resilient even in the most trying of times.

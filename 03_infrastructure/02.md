## Our “Four National Taps” strategy

To reduce our reliance on imported water and ensure that Singapore is self-sufficient in water before our last Water Agreement with Malaysia expires in 2061, PUB developed the “Four National Taps” strategy.

- **Local catchment water.** Rain water is captured with our 17 reservoirs and extensive network of drains and canals[^1]. However, because of Singapore’s small size, we lack ground space to collect and store sufficient water to meet our demand.

- **Imported water.** Linggiu Reservoir in Johor, five times larger than all of our 17 reservoirs combined, was built to enable Singapore to reliably draw water from the Johor River[^2].

[^1]:The Reservoirs are Pandan, Kranji, Jurong Lake, MacRitchie, Upper Peirce, Lower Peirce, Bedok, Upper Seletar, Lower Seletar, Poyan, Murai, Tengeh, Sarimbun, Pulau Tekong, Marina, Serangoon, and Punggol Reservoirs.

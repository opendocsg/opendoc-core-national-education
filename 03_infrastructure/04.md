Energy is a vital resource that is indispensable to a country’s development. But Singapore does not possess any significant energy resources of our own, and we depend heavily on energy imports to meet our domestic needs. 

### Singapore’s energy mix

Liquified natural gas (LNG), the cleanest fossil fuel, supplies about 95 per cent of our electricity generation needs. Coal, oil, solar and waste supply the remaining 5 per cent of our energy needs. 

In 2019, we used about 9,795 kilotonnes (ktoe) of energy to generate about 4,655 ktoe of electricity, numbers which have been steadily rising. 

But while we can procure what we need to keep our economy going and our hour homes running, we cannot simply rely on buying ever-larger amounts of energy. Singapore has been paying careful attention to maintaining energy security, economic competitiveness, and environmental sustainability - also known as the “energy trilemma”. 

### Energy security

Currently, more than 95 per cent of Singapore’s electrical supply comes from natural gas.  Most of our LNG supply is piped from Malaysia and Indonesia. This poses a key problem: a lack of diverse energy sources. Six of the existing gas contracts with Indonesia and Malaysia are due to expire between 2018 and 2029. And there is no guarantee if or when they will be renewed. 

To reduce our over-reliance on just two main sources of LNG, we have been working on expanding our suppliers beyond just our neighbours by creating ways for LNG to be transported to us.

In 2013, Singapore opened the first LNG Terminal, a significant milestone in our quest to fortify our energy security.  LNG supplies can now come from anywhere around the world and be stored at the terminal. The LNG terminal has enough capacity to meet our domestic needs even if the LNG agreements are new renewed. It was so successful that plans are now in place to build a second LNG terminal in the east.

### Economic competitiveness

With a high dependence on energy imports, especially LNG, Singapore has little control over energy prices. LNG prices closely track oil prices, the result of commercial contracts that link LNG to oil. And because oil prices are set by the market and oil producers, Singapore is highly exposed to any volatility that could affect oil prices. 

For one thing, should oil prices rise quickly, there could be knock-on effects for the economy. A sharp price rise could quickly escalate costs for many businesses – and hurt Singapore’s economic growth prospects.

Singapore has been grappling with the challenge of balancing economic competitiveness. While other oil-importing countries can afford to subsidise high oil prices, this could lead to huge deficits for SingaporeSingapore should oil prices rise quickly. Hence, instead of subsidies, the Singapore government turned to competition to keep prices fair and affordable for both companies and households.

Since the 1990s, Singapore has been progressively allowing private companies into the electricity market to nudge providers to become more cost-effective and better serve customers. In 2018, Singapore introduced the Open Electricity Market, which allowed households to choose their electricity provider instead of buying from just one source. 

### Environment sustainability 

Beyond ensuring that energy sources are available and are priced affordably, we also focus on sustainability. The threat of climate change has severe repercussions for Singapore and Singaporeans. In addition to warmer days and erratic weather, we also face the bigger threat of but it’s rising sea levels that poses.

Hence, we continue to push towards cleaner and renewable energy. For instance, over the last decade, the number of grid-connected solar installations in Singapore has increased from 30 to 3,000. By 2025, we aim to utilise 1.5 gigawatt-peak of solar energy – enough to power about 260,000 households annually.

We cannot expect solar to fully replace LNG – even if all of Singapore was covered with solar panels, solar would still not produce enough energy for all our needs – but we will continue to try to use more clean energy to reduce our carbon footprint.

In 2019, then-Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing announced that Singapore would ramp up our solar energy output even though it will be challenging.

Innovation lies at the heart of our clean energy push. Solar technology now may not be efficient, but with research and development and a drive to experiment and think out of the box, we hope we will be able to fully harness the sun's power for our energy needs. 

We are also looking into new and emerging sources of energy. Singapore’s Four Switches is a long-term plan that looks to pivot Singapore towards clean energy such as solar, regional power grids, and emerging technologies such as hydrogen fuel cells.  

The Energy Market Authority (EMA) is constantly encouraging innovation within the industry by test-bedding projects and programmes. For instance, it launched the inaugural Singapore Energy Grand Challenge in 2020 to develop new technologies and solutions to strengthen Singapore’s energy efficiency and security. 

But the reality is that any choice we make will involve trade-offs. Reducing carbon emissions will inevitably set “real cross-cutting constraints” on development, said Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean, who also chairs the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change. “The trade-offs are real, and often the choices are difficult,” he added. 

For instance, Singapore became the first country in Southeast Asia to introduce a carbon tax in 2018 – a move that will look to reduce carbon emissions across all sectors. Raising taxes will hopefully nudge companies to move towards cleaner energy and operations. But any new tax will hurt companies and potential affect Singapore’s economic growth prospects in the long run.

Despite the sacrifices, switching to sustainable energy sources is necessary to secure the country’s long-term future.

## <font color="#9F213D">Sand</font>

Every year, Singapore grows larger by a fraction thanks to land reclamation efforts. It has expanded by a fifth over the decades, from 581.5 km2 in 1960 to 725.7km2 in 2019. The country aims to reach 766km2 of landmass by 2030. 

Reclaimed land has been a key driver of our economic growth. Infrastructure such as Changi Airport, Tuas Port and Jurong Island have all been built on land reclaimed from the sea.

Sand has been crucial to enlarging this limited land space. In its early reclamation projects, Singapore could acquire sand locally. The East Coast Reclamation Scheme, for example, used soil from flattened hills in the Siglap and Tampines area to expand the land in Bedok. 

Once local sources ran out, Singapore turned to importing sand from overseas. According to a 2019 United Nations Environment Programme’s sand sustainability report, it has been the world’s largest importer of sand for the last 20 years, bringing in an estimated 517 million tonnes of sand from neighbouring countries.
 
However, there have been difficulties in getting sand from abroad. Countries like Malaysia and Indonesia have banned sand exports to Singapore over the years, citing environmental concerns. When Indonesia announced the ban in 2007, it created a supply crunch in Singapore, as 90 per cent of the country’s sand came from Indonesia. Malaysia followed suit in 2018.

As sand is also an essential material for concrete, there were concerns that this would disrupt the construction industry, delaying key infrastructure projects such as the Circle Line MRT and Integrated Resorts. 

In response, Singapore released its national stockpile of sand to the market to ensure a sufficient supply. We also took on 75 per cent of the price increase of sand for public projects and began procuring sand from other countries such as Vietnam and Cambodia.

The issue of sand imports has also sparked controversy. In 2018, a Cambodian filmmaker documentary claimed that Singapore’s sand imports had destroyed the livelihoods of a community on an island off Cambodia’s coast. It went viral and made international headlines. 

Singapore has stated that we sets strict criteria on sand imports. In 2019, the Ministry of National Development (MND) said that suppliers must “source sand from legally permissible areas and comply with all environmental laws of the source countries.”  Cambodia has since banned all sand exports to Singapore.

While achieving self-sufficiency in sand will be challenging, we are looking for ways to reduce our reliance on it.

One alternative suggested is empoldering, a method that will reduce the need for imported sand. Pioneered by the Netherlands, it involves building a sea wall around an area to be reclaimed from the sea, then draining the water using pumps. 

The method is expected to save Singapore 40 per cent in sand volume and construction cost.  It is already being used in reclamation works in Pulau Tekong. The island’s size will increase by 810 ha – about the size of two Toa Payoh towns – by 2022. The Housing Development Board (HDB) is also currently exploring empoldering technologies more suited to Singapore’s specific requirements. 

Singapore is also exploring whether empoldering can be used to reclaim more land along the eastern shoreline – a move that will free up space for more residential and commercial developments. This will also be an effective weapon in the fight against climate change, as building seawalls around Singapore’s coastline will offer protection against rising sea levels. 

Another method is to recycle construction debris, which would also help alleviate the demand for sand in the construction sector. Under the Building and Construction Authority’s (BCA) Demolition Protocol, reusable and non-reusable parts of a building must be identified and then separately dismantled. This approach has led to the production of new materials such as recycled concrete.

## <font color="#9F213D">Waste Management</font>

According to the National Environmental Agency (NEA), about 5.88 million tonnes of solid waste was generated in 2020 – the equivalent of 32,000 Jumbo Jets.

Paper and cardboard were disposed of the most and made up almost 20 per cent of total waste generated, followed by ferrous metal and plastics.

Singapore has invested in some of the world’s most advanced waste management systems. At present, there are four Waste-to-Energy (WTE) plants with a fifth plant in Tuas slated to be operational in 2021, and one off-shore disposal site at Semakau Landfill.

The process of incineration at WTE plants reduces waste by up to 90 per cent and saves landfill space. Heat is also recovered to produce steam that propels turbine-generators to generate electricity, providing up to 3 per cent of the country’s power needs.

The incineration ash and other non-incinerable waste are then transported to the Tuas Marine Transfer Station (TMTS). From there, they are barged to Semakau Landfill for final disposal.

Much consideration has been put into managing Singapore’s waste due to its limited land space for landfills or dumping grounds. At the same time, Singapore is grappling with the parallel challenge of sustainability – how do we reduce the amount of waste we generate? 


### Timeline: A Look at Waste Management Over the Years 
![](/assets/waste Infographics.png)

***WTE Incineration: A Bold First Step***<br>
Singapore took a bold step in the 70s and invested in Waste-to-Energy (WTE) Incineration. Faced with a shortage of space for landfilling in the 70s, Singapore took a bold step to invest in technology only available in Europe and Japan. S$100 million was set aside to build the first WTE Incineration plant in Asia outside of Japan. 

Then-Director General of Environmental Public Health, Daniel Wang, was put in charge of constructing the plant, located at Ulu Pandan and spoke of the responsibility of and pressure on his team to ensure that the money was well-spent.

However, he credits the political leaders then for having “really clear foresight as to the need for [an incineration plant]”. Apart from reducing waste to just one-tenth of its volume, the WTE plant also generated energy and scrap iron for sale from its ash residue.

Indeed, we have come a long way since that first step. 

```
“During my NS days, I had the privilege to visit Lorong Halus landfill as we were instructed to get rid of some used furniture from our camp at Paya Lebar Air Base. As we were entering the landfill, the first thing that caught my attention was the smell. It was really bad. Due to the smell, every one of us on the tonner ‘suddenly’ became very efficient. We took more than an hour to load all the things onto the tonner to be thrown at Lorong Halus but we managed to clear everything from the tonner in 20 minutes when we were there. During the entire saga, every one of us held our breath for as long as we can. While we were there, I noticed an old uncle standing in the middle of the landfill directing traffic, telling the driver where they should unload their trash. It struck me that he doesn’t mind the smell at all. Having the chance to visit the Semakau landfill two years ago makes me realise that we have come a long way in terms of our solid waste management. 

Today at Semakau, there is no smell as the solid waste are all incinerated and their volume has been greatly reduced to allow us to make use of the island for many more years to come. Without the advancement of our technology and processes, this would be a different story.”

### The Way Forward: Becoming a Zero Waste Nation, Together

The Semakau Landfill is expected to handle Singapore’s waste disposal needs for another two decades or so. But Singapore is not resting on its laurels. Instead, it is looking at ways to improve its waste management infrastructure and also urge its people to reduce and recycle, to extend the landfill’s capacity as far as possible into the future.

As Singapore’s waste output is projected to increase, it is working towards becoming a Zero Waste Nation through the reduction of consumption, as well as the reusing and recycling of materials to reduce waste generation at its source. As part of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, it aims to increase its recycling rate to 70% by 2030 and concurrently reduce the amount of waste sent to Semakau by 30%.

Singapore will continue to upgrade its infrastructure to remain at the forefront of waste management. The Integrated Waste Management Facility (IWMF) is expected to be completed by 2028 and will utilise new technologies to maximise both energy and resource recovery from solid waste.  Both water reclamation and waste management have been identified to share common processes and have many beneficial synergies. The IWMF will be co-located with the Tuas Water Reclamation Plant (TWRP) and both facilities are designed to be self-sustaining. This state-of-the-art facility will spearhead Singapore’s drive towards sustainability in the future and is poised to be as groundbreaking as the Ulu Pandan WTE Incineration Plant in the 1970s.

Apart from upgrading infrastructure, education has been stepped up to change attitudes and behaviours towards reducing, reusing and recycling.

To effectively promote a zero-waste lifestyle, MSE and the NEA work closely with schools, businesses, community groups, NGOs, and civil society groups to rally the ground and raise awareness on waste issues through their networks.

Many of these initiatives complement the efforts of the government. For instance, the charity organisation Zero Waste SG started as a website in 2008 and has since run several initiatives, such as a recycling campaign and a BYO (Bring Your Own) initiative – where it rallied over 1,000 businesses to encourage Singaporeans to bring their reusable bags, bottles or containers.

In light of success brought about by ground-up initiatives, the Towards Zero Waste Grant was set up in 2019 to fund ground-up projects that drive waste reduction and recycling or encourage households to recycle more and recycle right. In 2019 alone, close to 2,000 activities were organized in support of the Zero Waste initiative.

There are also efforts by the government to draw greater attention and consideration towards waste generation and reduction. The mandatory reporting of waste data and Environmental Public Health Act (EPHA) was amended in 2014 to enact the reporting of waste data by businesses and commercial entities such as hotels and shopping malls and also requires them to propose waste reductions plans. Furthermore, in 2019, the Resource Sustainability Act was enacted to legislate new measures to address waste streams such as the on-site food waste treatment systems in large commercial and industrial premises.

### Challenges Ahead

There are still barriers in Singapore’s drive towards zero waste. For instance, Singaporeans are still generally unaware when it comes to recycling. This lack of knowledge contributes to a lowered domestic recycling rate and more commonly, leads to the contamination of recycled goods. The NEA states that 40 per cent of recycling placed in blue bins gets contaminated by non-recyclables such as food waste and hence, cannot be recycled.


![](/assets/waste-7.png)
<br>
*[Image: NEA](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/3r-programmes-and-resources/food-waste-management)*

As part of this framework, legislative action has been taken in the form of the 2019 Resource Sustainability Act which addresses priority waste streams, such as food and e-waste. The requirements relating to food waste are:
* From 2021, developers of new large commercial and industrial premises to allocate and set aside space for on-site food waste treatment systems in their design plans and;
* From 2024, large commercial and industrial food waste generators will have to segregate their food waste for treatment.

However, the preferred way to manage food waste is to avoid wasting food at the onset.

NEA launched a **Food Waste Reduction (FWR)** outreach programme in November 2015 to encourage the adoption of smarter shopping, storage and preparation habits that help consumers save money while reducing food wastage. 

In addition, NEA and the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) have worked with the food industry to publish food waste minimisation guidebooks for food retail establishments, supermarkets and food manufacturing establishments to reduce food waste across the supply chain.

E-waste is also being targeted as it contains small amounts of heavy metals and other substances of concern (e.g., in printed circuit boards). The wide variety of e-waste also makes it hard to generalise material content. For instance, the material composition of a mobile phone is very different from that of an electric kettle. Hence, the management of e-waste is effort-consuming and costly.

Management of e-waste starts upstream and at the very beginning during the manufacturing stages. Singapore has several restrictions on hazardous substances for electrical and electronic equipment. For instance, the local sale of batteries exceeding a stipulated mercury content is not allowed. This way, used batteries can be safely discarded along with normal household waste at our WTE incineration plants.

At this point, e-waste recycling has been largely voluntary, with the NEA working closely with industry partners and the community. While voluntary e-waste recycling measures have yielded encouraging results, the NEA recognises the limitations of a voluntary approach and in turn, the need for a regulated system in the long run. At the moment, studies are underway to develop feasible systems for the collection and recycling of e-waste.

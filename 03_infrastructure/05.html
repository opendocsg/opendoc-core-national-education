<h2 id="public-transport-network"><font color="#9F213D">Public Transport Network</font></h2>

<p><img src="/assets/upcs-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As the most space-efficient way that allows large numbers of people to travel, Singapore’s public transport network has been crucial in helping us manage our limited land space.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/upcs-2.png" alt="" />
<em>Image: MOT</em></p>

<p>Beginning from the 1950s, buses were the primary mode of public transport. However, in 1967, the State and City Planning Project, which had been initiated that same year, proposed building a rail system to develop Singapore’s public transport system. This rail proposal was later incorporated into the 1971 Concept Plan to serve a rapidly growing population and ease traffic congestion problems.</p>

<p><u> Great Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Debate </u>
of the project. Expected to cost S$5 billion, it was to be the most expensive public project undertaken by Singapore at that time. The ‘Great MRT Debate’ ensued, with founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and then-Finance Minister Goh Keng Swee on opposing sides. While the PM Lee supported the MRT plan as it would bolster economic and social growth, Dr Goh was unsure if the high costs would make it a worthy investment.</p>

<p>Instead, Dr Goh advocated for a cheaper all-bus system. However, the 1982 Comprehensive Traffic Study later deemed that Singapore’s limited land could not cater for the amount of road space that an all-bus system required.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/upcs-3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Eventually, after nine studies that spanned a decade, Singapore decided to build the MRT, which first opened in 1987.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/upcs-4.png" alt="" />

<p>The new public transport system enabled the government to decentralise urban centres. With a robust public transport system, residential areas could be moved farther away from the city centre, freeing up space in the central business district (CBD). a process of ‘decentralisation’ – of moving freeing up space in the central business district (CBD) – as residential areas could be built around the stations. Businesses and industries could also be moved outside of the CBD to create pockets of residential and commercial activity in the heartlands.</p>

<p>This was the case in Toa Payoh. When the town was being constructed in the early 1970s, a plot of land was set aside for the future construction of the MRT. Light industries set up shop alongside residential estates, which created jobs in the heartlands and prevented the transport system from being overloaded.</p>

<p><em><img src="/assets/upcs-6.png" alt="" />

<p>Today, the MRT system is the backbone of Singapore’s public transport system.    Singapore has six MRT lines consisting more of than 130 stations, with about 200km of rail spanning the island. It is complemented by the bus system, which provides connections between residential towns and MRT stations. The MRT and bus systems are brought together by the Integrated Transport Hubs (ITHs) – bus interchanges linked to MRT stations and commercial developments such as shopping malls. There are currently nine ITHs in Singapore.</p>

<p>The Government has also committed to building more MRT lines to alleviate the load on existing lines. The Land Transport Authority’s (LTA) Land Transport Master Plan (LTMP) 2013 included plans to further improve Singapore’s rail connectivity to reach more housing and industrial areas, with an eventual aim to have eight in 10 households live near an MRT station by 2030.</p>

<p>However, expanding the MRT network no doubt involves trade-offs. For instance, there were environmental concerns over constructing the future Cross Island Line, as it would cut through the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, as seen below, and cause environmental harm.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/upcs-7.png" alt="" />
<em>Image: Cross Island Line / LTA</em></p>

<p>In response, LTA spent six years engaging in discussions with various interest groups. It spoke to residents in the affected Thomson area worried about losing their homes, and had discussions with nature groups.</p>

<p>Eventually, after all the feedback, LTA adapted the plan. It decided not to cut through the Thomson residential area, opting instead to build the new line directly underneath the nature reserve. Moreover, to minimise environmental damage, LTA said that it would tunnel 70m below the surface (instead of the usual 20m to 30m for other MRT tunnels), even though this would cost at least S$20 million more. It also reduced the number of boreholes drilled in the reserve from 72 to 16 to mitigate the environmental impact of the required soil tests.</p>

<p>Another impetus to building our public transport infrastructure is to reduce our reliance on cars. It will allow us to remain connected, while lowering the impact that our mobility has on limited land space and resources.</p>

<h2 id="green-and-blue-spaces"><font color="#9F213D">Green and Blue Spaces</font></h2>

<p><img src="/assets/upcs-9.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>On 16 June 1963, then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew planted a pink mempat tree at Holland Circus.  It was the first step of a plan that would eventually see Singapore blossom into a ‘Garden City’.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/upcs-10.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Transforming Singapore into a ‘garden city’ was important for many reasons. For one, trees and other greenery keep the country free of pollution. Moreover, it was part of Singapore’s attempt to establish itself as a clean and green country to reflect our good governance and attract foreign investors. Greening efforts were thus accompanied by campaigns such as the ‘Keep Singapore Clean’ and ‘Tree Planting Day’.</p>

<p>Today, green spaces continued to reduce air pollution and urban heat, and provide a respite for urban dwellers surrounded by concrete and glass buildings. Today, Singapore has the world’s highest urban tree density, with two million trees lining the streets, and they benefit our living environments in countless ways.</p>

<p>Apart from green spaces, we have also made concerted efforts to turn our waterways blue and clear. As the late-MM Lee Kuan Yew mentioned in his book, ‘From Third World to First: The Singapore Story, 1965-2000’, one of the key reasons for cleaning up Singapore was to allow us to collect as much of our rainfall (95 inches per year) as possible. Thus, in the 1960s and 1970s, the Government made sure that all sewage from homes and factories emptied into the sewers. Only clean rainwater run-off was allowed into open drains that led into the rivers, which could in turn be used as drinking water. This eventually enabled Singapore to provide 63 million gallons of water per day by 1980 – about half of our daily water needs.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/upcs-12.png" alt="" />

<p>Between 1977 and 1987, the Government embarked on an ambitious clean-up of the then-heavily polluted Singapore River and Kallang Basin. On one hand, it was a massive engineering job that required laying underground sewers across the whole island. On the other, it also required relocating squatters which were a significant source of sewage discharge into the rivers, phasing out pig farms as pig waste were heavily pollutants, and moved people from around 3,000 backyard and cottage industries into industrial estates, where there was proper infrastructure to manage waste. Even with compensation, many were resistant to change.</p>

<p>Despite the discontent, the Government pressed on. The riverbeds were dredged to remove the toxic debris and sediment, while rubbish along the banks was removed. The efforts eventually paid off. By 1987, the Singapore River was transformed into a bustling waterfront area with shops and restaurants opening along the riverbanks.</p>

<p>It was one of the earliest examples of how waterways could enhance the urban landscape. In the past, Singapore’s bare concrete canals only served to prevent floods. However, in the 1990s, the Government also began exploring ways they could be used to beautify Singapore.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/upcs-13.png" alt="" />

<p>The Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters (ABC Waters) programme has been key to this ongoing effort. Through this programme, the Government looked to create scenic waterfront spaces for public recreational use. Unused spaces on the drainage reserves are transformed into attractive promenades, equipped with amenities.</p>

<p>The Kallang River @ Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park is the programme’s flagship project. Before 2009, it was just a 2.7km-long and empty concrete canal adjacent to the park. Under the ABC Waters programme, however, this waterway has transformed into a river. This has created opportunities for new lifestyle activities, and migratory birds and aquatic animals are often spotted there. The river is also designed to prevent floods, the greenery around it acts as a filter to eliminate pollutants in rainwater.</p>

<p>As then-Minister of National Development Lawrence Wong said, “We started out to be a Garden City. Now we’re making Singapore a City of Garden and Waters.”</p>

<p>Yet, Singapore always has to negotiate the balance between greenery and preserving biodiversity, with urban development. For instance, we have overcome some land limitations by building vertical gardens. In 2009, the NParks launched its Skyrise Greenery Initiative, which saw roof gardens on buildings. This has since become an essential component of Singapore’s greening strategy, and we aim to eventually have over 200ha of skyrise greenery across the island.</p>

<p>This balancing act can also be seen in our management of nature reserves as well. Singapore has safeguarded 7,800ha of land as nature reserves, areas, and parks, as well as green spaces such as parks and park connectors. However, our limited land and physical constraints mean that we have had to develop some green areas into urban spaces.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Screenshot 2021-07-14 at 1.14.21 PM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>For instance, the 30-hectare Lentor Forest was cleared for private housing in 2016. The construction of Tengah – Singapore’s newest town – also required about 90 per cent of the original forest in the area to be removed. In light of these developments, the public increasingly called for the need to preserve the country’s natural greenery.</p>

<p>When it came to the 33-hectare Dover Forest, which had been slated to be cleared for housing projects, the government launched a public consultation exercise at the start of 2021. It asked for the public to share its feedback, and many spoke spoken out against the zoning of Dover Forest and asked for it to be preserved. The forest is home to at least 158 animal species, including critically endangered ones, and 120 plant species. Nature Society (Singapore), for instance, raised concerns about the loss of biodiversity and wildlife connectivity with other green spaces in the vicinity, such as Clementi Forest. MND and HDB said that it would take the feedback into account.</p>

<p>What is key is that the answers to our urban development questions and the outcomes we arrive at are never straightforward. Minister for National Development Desmond Lee said that Singapore will need to continue balancing the needs of development and conservation as part of the long-term planning process. Two ways of doing so are to minimise and mitigate environmental impacts, as well as incorporate nature into urban developments where possible. For example, housing developments in Tengah complement the natural environment by retaining as much of the existing topography as possible. This improves the balance between maintaining natural areas and meeting development needs.</p>

<p>Singapore has also retained ecologically important green spaces that were initially set aside for other purposes. For instance, Mandai Mangrove and Mudflat was initially designated for industrial use. However, it was eventually retained after biodiversity surveys and ecological modelling were conducted, and will open as a nature park in 2022.</p>

<p>Within three decades of independence, the government had successfully addressed the basic needs of housing and jobs. As a result, urban development plans and priorities shifted at the start of the 1990s to improving the quality of life of residents. This is especially important in high-density cities where private space is limited.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/upcs-22.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Placemaking – creating meaningful spaces where people live, work and play – has thus become key to how Singapore shapes its public spaces in recent years. It was a key theme of URA’s 2019 Master Plan.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/upcs-23.png" alt="" />

<p>A well-designed public space encourages people to come together, interact and foster connections to the area. This ensures that precincts across Singapore will always remain relevant as shared spaces for gathering and activities.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/upcs-24.png" alt="" />

<p>The community has been involved in these placemaking projects. The Lively Places Programme – a joint initiative by HDB and URA – is one example. It supports community-led efforts, organising activities such as art classes in neighbourhoods and allowing installations like murals to be put up.  This has helped residents form close bonds with the areas they live in.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/upcs-25.png" alt="" />

<p>There are many examples of how Singapore has sought to make public spaces unique for Singaporeans.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/upcs-26.png" alt="" />
<em>Images: Precincts in the Pilot Business Improvement District Programme / URA</em></p>

<p>One example is the URA’s Business Improvement District (BID) programme. The BID has increased the allure of 10 precincts across Singapore, including City Hall, Singapore River, Jurong Gateway, and Paya Lebarthrough targeted marketing and events. The private sector independently takes charges of the programme, which provides stakeholders in the area, such as local businesses and communities, with a sense of ownership.</p>

<p>The Singapore River One programme is another example, with the waterfront bolstered by events such as the Singapore River Festival. Street benches and playgrounds have also been installed to encourage recreational activities there.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/upcs-27.png" alt="" />
<em>Image: Somerset Belt Masterplan / NYC and MCCY</em></p>

<p>Another is the Somerset Belt Masterplan, which has involved young Singaporeans in transforming the Somerset area into a vibrant youth precinct. To date, almost 10,000 youths have participated to co-create this space alongside the Government. For example, they have conceptualised a ‘Dual Spine Experience’. This divides the Somerset area into two zones: an Active spine reflecting dynamic street life features such as graffiti art and a Quiet spine with cosy spaces providing an escape from the city bustle.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/upcs-28.png" alt="" />
<em>Images: Our Tampines Hub and Heartbeat@Bedok / PA</em></p>

<p>The public housing heartlands is also another example of how public spaces can help create bonds through community hubs, which include facilities such as libraries, gyms, and polyclinics under one roof, integrated community hubs such as Tampines Hub and Heartbeat@Bedok have provided a common area for residents to bond and enjoy diverse activities together, and make more effective use of land.</p>

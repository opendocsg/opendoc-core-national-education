# Our Fundamentals 

**Optimise resources**

Singapore has limited land and natural resources, so we have to be organised and careful about using what little we have to create a liveable and sustainable city and home, while at the same time meet the residential, commercial, industrial, recreational and security needs of our people. 

**Operate sustainably**

As a low-lying island state in the equatorial region, Singapore is uniquely vulnerable to climactic changes. We are also home to fragile ecosystems and plant and animal species. We need to manage the impact of our urban development and human activity, so as not to harm our environment.


**Open up connections**

As a trade hub and global city, Singapore needs to build and maintain transport links internally, as well as externally to the rest of the world. Our world-class transport infrastructure makes it possible for people, goods and services to move efficiently and reliably at all times.

**Ownership of outcomes**

Singaporeans need to feel a sense of shared ownership for the nation so that we will defend and care for our country. Our public spaces, heritage buildings and home ownership motivate us to put down roots, raise families and act responsibly for our future, and build a world-class city we can be proud to call home.

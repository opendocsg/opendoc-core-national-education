# Urban Planning

A furry head pops up from the water, eyes darting around and checking for danger. It sniffs the air and gives the all-clear to the rest of his troop. One by one, the rest of the otter family pop their heads up, weaving their bodies through the clear waters at Kallang River, drawing delighted squeals from the families walking nearby.

It is not uncommon to spot the family of otters in the Kallang River. But they are not the only reason why Singaporeans often head down to walk by the riverside. For many, taking a walk along the water’s edge helps calm frazzled nerves, while the fresh air provides respite for the ragged urbanite. 

It was not always this case. In the 1970s, the Kallang River was more known for its stench than its sights. The sludge-filled water carried chicken carcasses, rotting fruit and a foul stench that blanketed the area. Similarly, most other waterways in Singapore were also heavily polluted.

It took an order by then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew to start a national effort to clean up the waterways around the island. Instead of dead animals, he wanted the rivers and canals to have “more or less clean, translucent water, where fish, water lilies, and other water plants [could] grow, and [for] both sides of the waterway [to] be planted with trees, like willow”. After decades of cleaning, we now have waters so clean that a wide range of animal and plant life thriving in our rivers and waterways.

The transformation of Singapore’s waterways from polluted to pristine is an example of how the Government has made it a priority to ensure that Singapore remains a safe and comfortable home for more than three million Singaporeans. 

The transformation did not, however, take place overnight. It took decades of meticulous planning, targeted execution and an ambitious vision. To this end, four factors have enabled Singapore to become an urban oasis.

## Thinking Long-Term 


![](/assets/up-5.png)

Singapore’s limited space means that we cannot afford to use our land haphazardly. Our urban planning approach has to optimise the scarce land we have to meet diverse needs, including housing, industries, green areas and recreation. 

To this end, the Government has taken an integrated and long-term approach to urban planning – the Concept Plan and the Master Plan. 

As the strategic land use and transportation plan that provides broad guidelines for Singapore’s physical development over the next 40 to 50 years, the Concept Plan provides the overall strategy. Its goal is to ensure sufficient space to support long-term population growth, economic development, and a good living environment.

Singapore’s first Concept Plan was published in 1971. The plan was a mammoth effort, involving more than 100 local and overseas urban planners, architects, civil servants and academics between 1967 and 1969. It laid the foundations of the land needs for the young nation, setting out the principles for developing housing estates, recreational spaces and industrial estates. Its legacies continue to this day, more than 50 years after the plan was published.

The Concept Plan set in place critical infrastructures instrumental to Singapore’s economic growth. This included the construction of Changi Airport, which opened in 1981, a Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system, and a network of expressways. The plan also earmarked the Central Area as the Central Business District (CBD). 

The second Concept Plan, published in 2001, focused on creating an island city that balanced work, play, culture and commerce. It proposed developing commercial corridors in different parts of the island to bring jobs closer to homes. One of Singapore’s most significant economic engines – Jurong Island – was also borne from this plan.

The idea of constructing Jurong Island came about in the 1980s with the plan to establish Singapore as a leading petrochemicals hub.This would reduce the economy’s dependence on electronics manufacturing and strengthen Singapore’s position as a top oil refining centre. But more land was needed to build up the country’s petroleum and petrochemicals industry. The Government subsequently began reclaiming land off Singapore’s southwestern islands. 

The plan was to merge seven existing islands (Pulau Merlimau, Pulau Ayer Chawan, Pulau Ayer Merbau, Pulau Seraya, Pulau Sakra, Pulau Pesek, and Pulau Pesek Kecil) into one. The project, built at more than $7 billion, involved massive dredging to triple 10 square km of usable space to 32 square km.  

The engineering feat was achieved after meticulous planning. The engineers put together a detailed blueprint to maximise project efficiency and minimise costs. The designers planned shared facilities, centralised logistics, and common corridors. 

Reclamation works for Jurong Island began in 1995 – the project was so ambitious that it was initially estimated that the project could be completed only by 2030. But the detailed planning and creative engineering helped speed up the process. The island was fully reclaimed by 2009 – 20 years ahead of schedule. 

Jurong Island houses the biggest petrochemicals companies globally in an integrated facility that combines the different parts of the chemicals supply chain. Since the official opening in 2000, Jurong Island has attracted over $50 billion worth of investments.

The latest Concept Plan, published in 2011, looks further into the future, with an eye on providing and sustaining a high-quality living environment for future generations of Singaporeans. The plan sets out parameters for providing affordable homes, enhancing mobility with greater transport connectivity and growing an economy with good jobs.

While the Concept Plan takes care of the broad, long-term strategies, the Master Plan goes into detail. It focuses on the medium-term and is reviewed once every five years, guiding Singapore’s development over the next 10 to 15 years. The plan lays out the specifics for individual plots of land.

For example, the 2003 Master Plan focused on enhancing and protecting Singapore’s natural and heritage sites. The Southern Ridges – completed in 2008 – is one such example, when the plan first conceived linking various hill parks with the construction of two iconic bridges.

This approach to long-term planning is a crucial reason we can develop our tiny island with an eye on the future. Likewise, our approach to planning was also a key factor that led to our public transport network development. We have had to project into the future – a process that requires us to think beyond our present needs.

## Creating a Sustainable Economy
	
While the immediate priority upon independence was to create jobs and kick-start a stuttering economy, it was clear from the outset that Singapore could not pursue “growth at all costs” and ignore the trade-offs. 

Singapore was committed to sustainable development from the start. With our small land area, we simply cannot afford to implement a development model that placed economic growth over the environment. The “develop first, clean up later” model could permanently scar whatever little land we had – a risk that the Government was unwilling to take. Instead, the Government took the more challenging route by making economic decisions with the environment in mind. 


![](/assets/up-11.png)

For instance, when giant Japanese corporation Sumitomo wanted to build Singapore’s first petrochemical plant in the mid-1970s, the Government insisted that it met specific environmental requirements. Sumitomo protested, arguing that such an approach would be costly. Despite the risk of losing a critical foreign investment, the Government did not budge. Eventually, Sumitomo relented. 

The Government also located industries in the west of Singapore, where there were few residential estates. 

There were also practical considerations to wanting a “Clean and Green” environment. For one thing, it allowed us to stand out from our neighbours, especially when it comes to tourism and attracting global talent.

Today, being clean and green is more than just about keeping our roads free from litter and our air unpolluted. Climate change is one of our biggest challenges, and it is one that the Government is paying close attention to. As an island, the rise of sea levels will have deep impacts on our living environment, making climate change an existential issue. In 1992, the Government released the Singapore Green Plan (SGP) – its first formal plan to balance environmental and developmental needs. The plan has since gone through two more versions: SGP 2012 and SGP 2030. 

SGP 2030, pictured below, is a wide-ranging plan that will see Singapore adopt green initiatives across all sectors of society. This will range from schools going carbon neutral to establishing Singapore as a leading centre for green finance. It will look to secure “a Singapore for our future generations,” as PM Lee Hsien Loong said.

## Engaging the Community

Citizens play a crucial role in Singapore’s urban planning approach. In his 2011 National Day Rally Speech, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had said the country needed ‘active citizens’ to change Singapore for the better. 

As more Singaporeans become more educated and informed, they also want to be more involved in the country’s development.  The Government started taking on a more consultative approach when it came to involving citizens in shaping our island and its development. 

One example was the 2001 Concept Plan. While conceptualising past Master and Concept Plans previously involved only the likes of professionals, academics and the Government, citizens were now roped into the planning process. An extensive public consultation exercise was carried out with the formation of two focus groups that comprised everyday Singaporeans such as working professionals, grassroots members and students. These groups explored two things: balancing Singapore’s scarce land resources and preserving our identity through heritage sites.

The preservation of the Chek Jawa coastal wetlands was a result of this consultative approach. When its eastern tip was slated for reclamation, a public forum hosted by the URA in 2001 debated on this issue, arguing that the move would destroy much of the rich biodiversity found there.  Reclaiming Chek Jawa would also adversely impact existing natural eco-systems in the east of Pulau Ubin – an island known for its rich natural heritage.

A public campaign to save Chek Jawa ensued. Singaporeans wrote into the press and ministries, and the MND conducted a public feedback forum where nature groups voiced their concerns. They also submitted alternative proposals backed by scientific arguments. 

On 20 December 2001, then-Minister for National Development Mah Bow Tan also held dialogues with several nature groups to discuss saving Chek Jawa’s wildlife. MND then decided to defer the reclamation project and consult with experts on the solutions to protect the marine life in the area.

Instead, plans were drawn up to protect and preserve the biodiversity at Chek Jawa. The Government spent $6.2 million to build boardwalks, a viewing tower and a visiting centre that allowed the public to visit Chek Jawa without harming the fragile eco-system there.

Over the years, many groups of Singaporeans have also volunteered for coastal clean-ups and to preserve the biodiversity in Chek Jawa. It is a space that has enabled environmental stewardship, particularly amongst the youth, and helped cultivate love and appreciation for nature. It is this passionate activism that has also helped protect wildlife in the fragile ecospheres in the Chek Jawa inter-tidal zones.

## Preserving a Unique National Identity

Over the decades, conserving historic buildings has become an important component in Singapore’s urban planning. As an essential part of our nation’s heritage and cultural identity, these buildings remind us of what came before.

In the early years of nation-building, economic development and housing were Singapore’s priorities. Many historical buildings were torn down as part of urban renewal. 
 
But the Government recognised that our buildings are a critical part of our heritage and that there is a need to preserve them for future generations.


![](/assets/up-20.png)

In 1971, the Government passed the Preservation of Monuments Act, a move to conserve historic sites and monuments. The newly created Preservation of Monuments Board (PMB) would be the authoritative body in charge. By 1973, the board had already placed the first eight buildings under its protection. This included the St. Andrew’s Cathedral, Telok Ayer Market (Lau Pa Sat), and Sri Mariamman Temple.

In 1986, the URA launched its Conservation Master Plan. It earmarked six historical areas such as Chinatown and Little India for conservation.  Previously, conservation efforts were made only for individual buildings. Conserving these historical and ethnic districts strengthened the nation’s social fabric, as they represent Singapore’s ethnic groups and reflect their importance to Singapore’s multicultural heritage. Conserving these sites also gives Singapore’s cityscape its unique identity. 

But there have been times where the Government has had to make a difficult choice between development and conservation. This happened in 2000 when it was announced that the former National Library building at Stamford Road had to be demolished. The move was to make way for constructing a tunnel that would alleviate the heavy traffic between the Marina and Orchard area.

The decision sparked public debate. Many opposed the move, as the red-bricked building was an iconic landmark for many Singaporeans. After exploring various alternatives, such as expanding Stamford Road to allow more traffic flow and digging a deeper tunnel that would leave the library untouched, the Government concluded that removing the building remained the best option. In 2004, the building was torn down. 

This difficult decision illustrates the complexity in deeming what to conserve in Singapore. On the one hand, culture and history are important; on the other, there is the constant need to grow our economy and develop the country’s infrastructure. Balancing both sides is not an easy task and requires trade-offs. Nevertheless, we have tried to preserve important historical sites even as we continue to renew our built environment. 

To date, the Urban Redevelopment Authority has given conservation status to over 7,000 buildings in Singapore.  Many of them have been repurposed for Singaporeans to now enjoy. Examples include the Warehouse Hotel – formerly a warehouse dating back to 1895 – and the Jurong Town Hall, Jurong Town Corporation’s former headquarters that is now home to the Trade Association Hub.

	“Using a collaborative approach involving government organisations, the public, and developers, the Island Republic’s Urban Redevelopment Authority has achieved a balance between free-market economics and cultural conservation”, stated a jury from the Asia-Pacific Urban Land Institute in 2006 when it commended URA for its conservation programme. 

Preserving the unique character of our physical landscape also entails creating a sense of place – a place for the community to gather, interact and grow. Singapore’s efforts to develop spaces for communities has grown beyond simply creating functional spaces and towards the idea of placemaking.

## Conclusion
	
Building a home is more than erecting four walls, constructing a roof and laying out a floor. A home is filled with people, memories and a space that evokes a sense of place.

With some planning, a dose of imagination and a firm commitment to carry through our plans, we hope our tiny island can continue to be a home that we will all enjoy and love for ourselves and future generations of Singaporeans.

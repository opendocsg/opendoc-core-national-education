<p><em>5 minute read</em></p>

<p>In recent conversations on racial harmony in Singapore, the Special Assistance Plan (SAP) has repeatedly come up as an example of racial inequality in our education system.</p>

<p>Dominant narratives in the media today tend to cast the SAP as examples of ‘Chinese privilege’, ‘Chinese elitism’ or even ‘Singapore’s own bumiputera policy’ while overlooking the precise reasons for their founding.</p>

<p>More nuanced discussions tend to include some mention of the historical reasons, but often fail to consider the underlying considerations or the presence of real alternatives. While engaging in civil discourse is important, especially for our young people, we should not allow narratives that do not reflect the full picture to take center-stage in the conversation. Let us take a look back at the history of the SAP, to understand how it came about and why it still exists today, and how its intention is not to provide benefits to any one particular race.</p>

<h3 id="the-history-of-the-sap">The History of the SAP</h3>
<p>In the 1960s to 1970s, as English gained greater importance as the lingua franca in Singapore, parents began to send students to English-stream schools instead of vernacular schools. This led to the closing of many vernacular schools, and the proposed merger of Chinese-medium Nanyang University and English-medium University of Singapore, which was completed in 1980.</p>

<p>This decline led to the concern over preserving the best Chinese-medium schools in Singapore, especially those with rich histories dating from the early 1900s. Then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew believed in the value of preserving these schools, because he believed the traditional Chinese values taught through the Chinese language would help strengthen Singapore society. Therefore, the SAP was implemented in 1978, to develop nine Chinese-medium secondary schools into bilingual institutions with comparable standards of English to other schools. In the next 15 years, as most of the Chinese-medium primary schools closed down due to declining enrolment, MOE extended the SAP to 10 primary schools, followed by another five later on.</p>

<p>The excellent performance of the first batch of SAP school students in the O-level examinations contributed to a significant increase in the number of applications for SAP schools. Thanks to the SAP, schools like Nanyang Girls’ High School and Hwa Chong Institution, which were involved in historical moments during World War II when they were used by allied defenders, were preserved.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/social-images-21.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="related-programmes-and-campaigns">Related programmes and campaigns</h3>
<p>Along with the SAP, the government also introduced the Speak Mandarin Campaign from 1979, to encourage Chinese in Singapore to learn and speak Mandarin instead of their dialects. The standardization of Chinese as the vernacular was intended to reduce the language barriers between the different dialect-speaking Chinese groups, and facilitate communication with Mainland Chinese. However, forcing these dialect-speaking Chinese to learn Mandarin in schools along with English essentially made them learn two second languages. This “sacrifice” of Chinese dialects in schools, accompanied by the elimination of dialect programmes from local media, led to the near-elimination of dialect-speaking ability within one generation. This loss of our cultural-linguistic heritage is a key example of the trade-offs our founding fathers had to make to secure our economic future.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/speakmand.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>In 2005, with the strengthening of the Chinese economy, the Bicultural Studies Programme (BSP) was established in 3 SAP schools to develop among students a strong understanding of China’s history, culture and contemporary developments, in addition to a good command of the Chinese language. In 2007, a review taskforce chaired by the then Minister of State Gan Kim Yong encouraged SAP schools to develop their own flagship programmes related to the learning of the Chinese language, culture and traditions. This led to the introduction of examinable and non-examinable subjects in the different SAP schools centered on Chinese.</p>

<h3 id="discussion--is-the-sap-still-useful-today">Discussion – Is the SAP still useful today?</h3>
<p>These policies were originally meant “to preserve traditional Chinese values and nurture bilingualism”, to facilitate business with China and allow Singapore to benefit from China’s economic rise. Although the preservation of these schools may have already been achieved, the trade impetus remains, as China has been Singapore’s largest trading partner since 2014. Singapore, too, has been the top foreign investor in China until 2017.  Furthermore, with less people speaking in their mother tongues (MT) at home and the quality of MT education decreasing over the years, the SAP seems all the more necessary to promote true bilingualism, not just for Mandarin but for Malay and Tamil as well.  However, this emphasis on language-learning for its economic value may actually backfire for Malay and Tamil, where members of the two communities view English instead as more important for success. Singapore is once again caught between difficult choices, and needs to find the right trade-off between honing our economic advantage and preserving our cultural heritage versus allowing the Anglicization of our society to continue.</p>

<p>If we choose to retain the SAP, the problem of racial segregation needs to be addressed – since its inception in 1979, concerns have been raised regarding the lack of opportunities for students in SAP schools for interracial mixing. In response, some SAP schools have made Malay a compulsory subject for lower secondary students, while others introduced opportunities for students to broaden their social interactions through community-based activities or exchanges with cultural groups and other schools. Although these measures were deemed sufficient in 1990, it is worth re-examining them in light of the recent anecdotal reports of students experiencing casual or outright racism at the hands of those from SAP schools.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>In a small multilingual society, open to the world, it is inevitable that society gravitates towards a common language, in this case the international lingua franca of English. However, to preserve our economic advantage in doing business with China as well as the cultural-linguistic heritage of each race-community, we need to find a balance between emphasising the learning of Mother Tongue languages, showing fairness and equality to all races, and preserving the high level of English we have. We should also work to dispel myths of systemic racial discrimination, to preserve the racial harmony we enjoy.</p>

<p><em>10 minute read</em></p>

<p>Every Racial Harmony Day, we remember the Maria Hertogh racial riots. It has been over 50 years since the riots, but the lessons remain ever relevant: racial harmony is something we must consistently maintain, especially in light of recent incidents in the past few years. Let us take a look at these incidents, and see what we can learn from them.</p>

<h3 id="make-curry-not-war">Make Curry, Not War</h3>
<p>In 2011, curry became the hot topic among Singaporeans. The incident, known as the “curry incident”, was sparked off when a Chinese family complained about the strong smell of curry coming from their Indian neighbour’s home.</p>

<p>With the help of the Community Mediation Centre (CMC), both families voluntarily eventually agreed to compromise: the Indian family would cook curry only when their Chinese neighbours were out of the house, and the Chinese neighbours would try their curry. The incident led to positive ground-up campaigns and reactions in support of the Indian family, such as the “Cook and Share a Pot of Curry” campaign.  In contrast, negative actions such as uploading a video stereotyping mainland Chinese immigrants and mocking them simply leads to more unhappiness and does not solve the issue.</p>

<p>In 2012, Singaporean Amy Cheong made the headlines after she launched a racist tirade against Malays and their wedding practices. She disparaged Malays for holding weddings at void decks and mocked their divorce rate. She was promptly fired from work and left Singapore after being shamed and threatened by netizens.  A police report was made against her, but she was let off with a stern warning after issuing a public apology.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Screenshot 2020-09-24 at 3.13.53 PM-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As Singapore welcomes a greater diversity of cultures, these two incidents shows us how communication and consideration for other cultures can go a long way in building a harmonious society.</p>

<h3 id="fake-news-real-emotions">Fake News, Real Emotions</h3>

<p>In 2016, a couple running the socio-political website, The Real Singapore, was charged for publishing incendiary fake news. One particular article about a Filipino’s fictitious complaints over Thaipusam fanned resentment against the Pinoy community here.  Ai Takagi and Yang Kaiheng, who were jailed for 10 months and eight months respectively, published the articles as early as 2013. Their site has since been shut down.</p>

<p>Then, in 2019, a post was uploaded to Facebook group “Complaint Singapore” claiming that police officers from the Public Transport Security Command (Transcom) unit practiced racial discrimination and targeted people by race. In the video, a Malay man was seen speaking aggressively to police officers, accusing them of checking mostly only Malays, but not other races.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Screenshot 2020-09-24 at 3.23.09 PM-2.png" alt="" />
<em>Screengrab of video, full video can be viewed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/cb956x/man_refuses_to_be_screened_by_transcom/">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>The post led to many different responses from the public, with some agreeing that the police are biased, screening more people from a particular race in supposedly random checks, while others disagreed and thanked the police officers for their work.</p>

<p>The police released a statement clarifying that “such allegations are untrue, baseless, irresponsible, and may stir up racial tensions”, and that most of the people checked on that shift were non-Malays.  Although the post was eventually taken down, the damage was done: it led some to cast doubts on the professionalism of our police force, and caused possible unhappiness within the Malay community. As words on the internet have the potential to become viral, we should be responsible, ensuring what we post is accurate to avoid causing unnecessary racial disharmony and unhappiness.</p>

<p>As a multi-racial society, we must be on our guard against sensationalist news that seek to divide us and pit us against one another.</p>

<h3 id="navigating-a-multi-religious-society">Navigating a multi-religious society</h3>
<p>In February 2016, controversy arose over Madonna’s first performance in Singapore, sparked by the Catholic Church’s advice for congregants to skip the show.  The Media Development Authority (MDA) had previously rated the show R18, and banned the performance of certain song items that were judged as religiously sensitive.  Some members of the public took issue with how the church, a religious body, had tried to persuade the authorities to disallow the concert.  They believed that religious organisations should not interfere with non-religious events. This sentiment re-emerged in 2019, with the banning of a concert by Swedish metal band Watain.</p>

<p>As a multi-religious society, Singaporeans need to be considerate to those who hold different religious views in our community. We must not allow any words or actions that are targeted at any religion and intended to cause offense to go unchallenged. However, we must also remain mindful not to impose our religious values on the common space for everyone, because Singapore remains a secular nation. As the authorities continue to try to balance these two priorities in a changing world, let us do our part by being more understanding of different religious beliefs.</p>

<h3 id="being-aware-of-sensitivities-thinking-of-others-lived-experiences">Being Aware of Sensitivities, Thinking of Others’ Lived Experiences</h3>

<p>In August 2016, teen blogger Amos Yee stood trial again for six charges of deliberate intent to wound religious feelings, and two charges of failure to turn up for police interviews.  He had previously been charged for a Youtube and blog post with the deliberate intent to wound religious feelings and for distributing obscene material.  Yee was sentenced to another 6 weeks’ jail from 13 October, before fleeing the country on 16 December to the United States to seek political asylum. Yee’s case provoked much discussion in Singapore, over both the severity of his charges despite his young age, as well as the limitations of free speech in Singapore with respect to religion. Although many members of the Christian community signed a petition claiming not to be offended by Yee’s original post in which he criticised Christians and called Jesus “power hungry and malicious” and “full of bull”,  Yee was still found guilty of the deliberate intent to wound religious feelings.</p>

<p>In 2018, an Indian national and Singapore permanent resident caused a stir on the internet after posting an image on Facebook of a Singapore flag being ripped to reveal an Indian flag. Many Singaporeans found the post disrespectful and insulting of Singapore, and wrote in to his employer’s Facebook page to call for his removal from his job. As a result, Mr. Avijit Das Patnaik was fired from his job and given a stern warning by the police.</p>

<p>Although the responses were mainly against his treatment of the flag, some also made anti-immigrant remarks centered on his Indian race, expressing their unhappiness about having to compete for jobs with non-locals. However, Singapore is a city of immigrants – more than 80% of our current population were immigrants. Mr Aviiit Das Patnaik explained that his intention was to show that though his heart was still with India, his body was wholly Singaporean as he had settled in his new home in Singapore.</p>

<p>As a global city, attempts should be made to be more understanding to immigrants of all races who have left their homelands for Singapore, and help them to settle down, appreciate, and come to love their new home. Singaporeans should be more understanding of their feelings towards Singapore, instead of jumping to conclusions. Of course, each side must also understand that misunderstandings may occur, and think carefully about the possible interpretations before acting.</p>

<p>Likewise, the “Brownface” incident in 2019 showed that paying close attention to racial sensitivities remains critical. In an advertisement, Chinese actor Dennis Chew dressed up as characters of different races, including as a Malay woman and an Indian man in office wear. His skin was also darkened as part of the get-up.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/https---cdn.cnn.com-cnnnext-dam-assets-190730041708-singapore-ad-backlash-0730-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Some Singaporeans took offence, calling the move racist. Others believed there was no malice behind the advertisement.  A pair of local internet personalities Preeti Nair and her brother Subhas then escalated the issue by making an expletive-ridden video that mocked the original advertisement. The Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) investigated the advertisement and found that while it had not breached any law, it was done in poor taste.  The involved parties, including the actor and creative agency, all issued apologies.  Ms Nair and her brother were also warned by the Ministry of Home Affairs after they apologised.</p>

<p>Discussion surrounding “brownface” were revived in 2020, when a photo of Raffles Institution students doing “blackface” resurfaced on social media. Such stereotypes of different races are harmful and hurtful for minorities, because it is viewed as reducing their race and culture to just their appearance and accents. We should continue to do our best to be sensitive and considerate to people from different races within our society, keeping in mind that what one finds acceptable may be offensive to others as a result of different cultures and lived experiences.</p>

<h3 id="educating-not-condemning">Educating, Not Condemning</h3>

<p>But there have also been incidents involving race that can be resolved amiably. One such case involved local online influencer Sheena Phua, who came under fire in 2019 after she made an Instagram post that called two men wearing turbans “huge obstructions” to her view at the Singapore Grand Prix. Her comment was seen as mocking the Sikhs.</p>

<p>However, the Sikh community’s reaction was gracious. They invited her on an informal tour around Central Sikh Temple, where she got to learn about the culture. Besides issuing apologies, she also released photos of the tour and thanked the Sikh community for its kindness.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/sheena-phua-sikh-750x375-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Each of these examples shows that keeping Singapore a multiracial and multicultural society remains a work in progress. Much has been achieved but more can be done to encourage mutual understanding among the population.</p>

<h3 id="community-building-conversations">Community-building conversations</h3>
<p>These different incidents have led to conversations in society on whether racism is built into our system, influenced by events happening in the western world. In particular, the recent George Floyd protests in the United States and around the world have once again revived discussion around issues of race and privilege, with the term “Chinese Privilege” coming into common usage.  Many locals have also come forward to share their experiences of casual and systemic racism in the recent ‘Regardless of Race’ dialogues in 2019, with some questioning the continued relevance of Special Assistance Plan (SAP) and Singapore’s Chinese-Malay-Indian-Others (CMIO) racial framework.</p>

<p>These conversations have the potential to promote greater empathy and compassion amongst Singaporeans, allowing minority voices to be heard and questions asked. By listening to one another and clarifying our doubts, we can learn how to better show compassion and consideration for one another, and how to create a more equal and harmonious society. However, such conversations should be held beyond formal events, and in casual settings as well, such as in our homes, schools, and hawker centres. In particular, older Singaporeans, or those who grew up in single-race communities, may tend to have more misconceptions and biases towards other races, which need to be dispelled through frank and open conversations with those they trust.</p>

<p>While these conversations may sometimes be difficult, let us all do our part in protecting the racial harmony of our Singapore society.</p>

<h3 id="update-to-the-maintenance-of-religious-harmony-act-2019">Update to the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act (2019)</h3>

<p>The Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act (MHRA) was enacted in 1990 to allow pre-emptive action to be taken to safeguard and maintain religious harmony in Singapore. The key principles which guide the MHRA to maintain religious harmony in Singapore are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Followers of different religions should exercise moderation and tolerance towards each other and their beliefs, and not instigate religious enmity or hatred; and</li>
  <li>Religion and politics should be kept separate</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Why the update?</strong><br />
The MHRA was updated on 7 October 2019 in consultation with various stakeholders, such as the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore, Islamic Religious Council of Singapore, National Council of Churches Singapore, Singapore Buddhist Federation, Taoist Federation, Sikh Advisory Board, Hindu Endowments Board, and Hindu Advisory Board. The amendments will help the authorities respond more effectively to incidents of religious disharmony, especially when dealing with quicker flows of information online and also aims to strengthen safeguards against foreign influences that may threaten our religious harmony. In addition, the MHRA makes it an offence to use religion as a reason to attack groups that may not be of a religious persuasion, such as the LGBT community.</p>

<p>The amendment was motivated by several events, such as the demonstrations in India in 2014 after edited pictures of Hindu gods were circulated over Facebook and WhatsApp. During that period, Singapore had also recently experienced heated debates on racial harmony with a “Brownface” incident in 2019, mentioned above.</p>

<p>**Four key amendments **</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1.	Introduce safeguards against foreign influence that may affect religious harmony
-- Ensuring that key administrative leadership positions in religious organisations are held by Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents. This does not apply to spiritual leaders
-- Mandating that donations to religious organisations from foreign sources are subject to disclosure requirements
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2.	Introduce the Community Remedial Initiative (CRI)
-- Under the CRI, the Minister for Home Affairs may offer a person who has wounded the feelings of another religious community to perform activities to better understand the affected community and an opportunity to mend ties
-- The CRI is not mandatory. However, if the offender agrees to complete the CRI, the minister undertakes not to refer the case for criminal prosecution
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>3.	Updates to the Restraining Order (RO)
-- The RO is updated to tackle the speed and spread of internet content that might cause widespread religious harmony
--	Scope of RO expanded to require an offender to remove offensive online content 
--	Removal of 14-day notice period for issuance of RO
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>4.	Consolidate offences related to religious harmony under the MHRA
-- The 2019 update will consolidate provisions currently covered under the Penal Code with the MHRA
-- The consolidation strengthens the mandate of the MHRA and ensures racial harmony is legally protected against issues that may threaten racial harmony
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="singlish-and-our-national-identity"><font color="#9F213D">Singlish and our National Identity</font></h2>
<p><em>5 minute read</em></p>

<p>While many today consider Singlish part of our national identity, this has not always been the case! Let us take a moment to explore Singapore’s complex relationship with English/Singlish over the years.</p>

<h3 id="the-history-of-english-in-singapore">The History of English in Singapore</h3>
<p>English was first introduced to Southeast Asia when the British colonial settlers arrived in the late 1700s, arriving on Singapore’s shores in 1819. However, Malay remained the lingua franca even up until the beginning of the 1900s. In the early 1900s, with the establishment of institutes of higher learning that taught in English, proficiency in English became key to social mobility in terms of further education and employment opportunities. As a result, English took on greater and greater importance, such that at the end of British colonial rule, English had become a language of prestige and was often used as a lingua franca between different ethnic groups.  This more widespread use of English led to the birth of a colloquial variant used in informal domains, influenced by the different languages and dialects spoken – also known as Singlish!</p>

<p>In 1960, a year after the People’s Action Party (PAP) came into power, it implemented a bilingualism policy that essentially made learning English mandatory in primary schools, followed by secondary schools in 1966.  Additionally, in post-independence Singapore, English was established as the official lingua franca, due its ethnic neutrality, as well as its economic benefits, in terms of international trade and access to English-language educational resources.</p>

<h3 id="the-war-against-singlish--the-speak-good-english-movement">The War Against Singlish – The Speak Good English Movement</h3>
<p>However, this shift entailed some sacrifices. Over the next few decades, Singaporeans struggled both with bilingualism, and with speaking good English.  The problem came to a head when a report emerged in the Straits Times in 1999 about declining English standards in Singapore, which some attributed to the pervasive use of Singlish. This provided the impetus for the launch of the Speak Good English Movement (SGEM) in April 2000, which emphasised speaking of grammatically-correct, internationally-understood English. The war against Singlish had begun.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/sgem.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>However, from the onset, the SGEM has not been without its challenges. Those who argued against Singlish usually emphasized the pragmatic benefits speaking standard English brought, in terms of social mobility and personal gain. However, this overlooks the fact that the prevalence of Singlish in Singapore society also carries with it its inherent value, as a means of communicating authenticity and building solidarity, although this finding seems to depend on gender and education levels.</p>

<p>Furthermore, with more Singaporeans going abroad and more foreigners living in Singapore, Singlish has become a type of transferrable skill, or a cultural commodity, that non-Singaporeans pick up and value.  In fact, a 2015 article in the BBC showcased numerous examples of non-Singaporeans speaking and showing appreciation of Singlish.  Recently, even films produced in Singlish have managed to win international acclaim at film festivals around the world, contradicting earlier claims by the government that Singlish lacks economic value, and is a hindrance to communication on an international stage.</p>

<p>Another common argument is that Singlish hinders one’s ability to learn and speak standard English, which is a crucial skill in this globalised world. However, some academics have questioned this assumption, arguing that Singlish is a natural manifestation in response to globalisation, that complements the presence and use of English in Singapore. Therefore, eradicating Singlish will not necessarily bring about an improvement in the level of standard English in Singapore, just as the elimination of a local culture might not necessarily lead to the embrace of a global one. Instead, Singaporeans should be exposed to and taught to value both Singlish and standard English, learning to use them in different contexts and to code-switch smoothly between them.</p>

<h3 id="validation-of-singlish--speak-good-singlish-movement-and-dictionary-endorsements">Validation of Singlish – Speak Good Singlish Movement and Dictionary endorsements</h3>
<p>In response to the SGEM, a Speak Good Singlish Movement (SGSM) was launched anonymously in September 2010, to celebrate the use of Singlish, and to distinguish “proper” Singlish from plain broken English.  This display of linguistic chutzpah, or confidence, shows the development of Singlish and its rejection of any anxiety about the use of Singlish, especially as a result of the SGEM.  In 2016, Singlish speakers received even more reason for their confidence, when the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) added 19 new “Singapore English” items to its lexicon, making it a grand total of 27 Singlish words in the prestigious dictionary.</p>

<p>This development cemented the central position Singlish occupied for the younger generation, with about half of the respondents of a recent survey claiming that Singlish is a part of Singapore’s national identity and culture.</p>

<h3 id="making-singlish-a-language-for-everyone">Making Singlish a language for everyone</h3>
<p>Despite these glowing endorsements, Singlish is far from established as part of our national identity. In a 2018 study by the Institute of Policy Studies, only eight per cent of respondents chose Singlish as the language they identified with the most, compared to one-third identifying with English, and 28 per cent with their official Mother Tongue languages.  Some Singaporeans have also begun to weaponise Singlish as a test of Singaporean-ness, resulting in Singlish becoming a discriminating force, rather than source of solidarity.  Those who were unable to speak Singlish ‘properly’ are labelled ‘fake’ Singaporeans, in a manner reminiscent of how English-educated Chinese were (are) mocked for being ‘bananas’.</p>

<p>Although Singlish still lacks acknowledgement as part of Singapore’s Intangible Cultural Heritage, its pervasiveness and status amongst Singaporeans cannot be ignored. Although many Singaporeans today fail to identify with Singlish the most, Singlish remains part of the sounds of Singapore, that lets Singaporeans arriving in Singapore know that they are home. As the world starts to take notice of our home-grown dialect, maybe it’s time for Singaporeans too to start thinking about protecting and preserving Singlish as something valuable to our culture and identity.</p>

<h2 id="unesco-bids-and-our-heritage"><font color="#9F213D">UNESCO Bids and Our Heritage</font></h2>
<p><em>4 minute read</em></p>

<p>As a young and small country with little to no natural heritage, Singapore still manages to punch above its weight, boasting one UNESCO World Heritage Site, and a bid to include an item in the Representative List (RL) of the Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) of Humanity. As Singaporeans, there is much to be proud of!</p>

<h3 id="the-singapore-botanic-gardens-journey-to-become-a-unesco-world-heritage-site">The Singapore Botanic Gardens journey to become a UNESCO World Heritage Site</h3>
<p>In 2015, after a 5-year application journey, the 161-year-old Singapore Botanic Gardens was awarded the status of UNESCO World Heritage Site (WHS), making it Singapore’s first UNESCO WHS.  Singapore’s Botanic Gardens is the first Botanic Gardens on the list from Asia, and the third Botanic Gardens on the entire list, joining the Orto botanico di Padova in Padua, Italy and the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, England.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/botgard.jpg" alt="" />
<em>Commemorative stamps launched to celebrate the inscription of the Singapore Botanic Gardens as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</em></p>

<p>In fact, as a former British colony, Singapore’s Botanic Gardens was once an outpost of the British Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. During the British empire, Botanic Gardens performed the dual function of advancing scientific knowledge and economic development. The Singapore Botanic Gardens played a large role in the development of the rubber trade in South-East Asia in the late 1800s, and in the breeding and hybridization of Orchirds in the mid 1900s, a field in which the Botanic Gardens remains unparalleled today. These achievements, along with the exceptional preservation of the gardens through the efforts of the many generations of Singaporeans involved, led to its achievement of the UNESCO WHS status. Our Singapore Botanic Gardens is truly something we can be proud of!</p>

<h3 id="singapores-hawker-culture-nomination-for-unescos-intangible-cultural-heritage-list">Singapore’s Hawker Culture nomination for UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage list.</h3>
<p>After the recognition of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, Singapore did not rest on its laurels. In March 2019, Singapore submitted its nomination for its hawker culture to be inscribed on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity (ICH).  This nomination serves as a recognition of hawker centres as communal dining spaces, of the hard work generations of hawkers have put in, and of the greater appreciation Singaporeans have begun to have for our hawkers and our hawker culture.  Although hawker culture may not have originated in Singapore, and is not exclusive to the island, it has grown to become something Singaporeans value as part of our culture, history and identity.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PcSEBDCRt-I" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Although many warned of the impending doom of Singapore’s hawker culture, support schemes and programmes from the government seems to have turned the trend around. Proof of the vibrancy and continuity of our hawker culture can be seen in the number of aspiring young hawkers we have, with examples like “Beng Who Cooks” rising to fame recently on the back of their charity work during circuit breaker.  Programmes like the Staggered Rent Scheme and the Incubation Stall Programme, which reduce the initial rent paid by new hawkers, have encouraged more young people today to venture into the hawker industry. A mentorship programme with experienced hawkers has also been set-up, to help young hawkers get their footing more quickly.  Although some of these newcomers have since thrown in the towel, many more continue to keep going and to thrive, particularly in the new not-for-profit social entreprise hawker centres like Timbre+ and the new Pasir Ris Central Hawker Centre. A “Next Gen Hawker Food Tour” has even been set-up, to explore the hawker stalls and eateries set-up by young hawkers, showing a desire by the public to support our young hawkers.</p>

<h3 id="protecting-and-preserving-our-cultural-heritage">Protecting and preserving our cultural heritage</h3>
<p>Although 9 in 10 respondents agree or strongly agree that hawker centres are an important part of Singapore’s identity, according to a 2016 survey by the NEA, we cannot take the continued survival of our hawker culture for granted. Only with the continued support of the government, of business-owners and all of us Singaporeans will we be able to keep this unique cultural heritage alive. Similarly, our Botanic Gardens need to continue to be maintained and developed in the years to come, to remain relevant and valuable to Singaporeans.</p>

<p>The richness of Singapore’s heritage doesn’t end with these two nominations. As part of the 2019 submission, the National Heritage Board is also collating an ICH inventory, comprising other traditions, rituals, crafts, expressions, knowledge and skills that we practise and pass on from generation to generation.  As of July 2020, this inventory already consists of a whopping 119 items, with the number set to continue increasing! As we look around and marvel at the many things that make Singapore our home, we must not forget that these things only exist today as a result of the preservation and effort put in by our forefathers. Let us work together as one Singapore, to preserve our unique cultural heritage for future generations, to make Singapore a home we can all be proud of.</p>

<h2 id="covid-19"><font color="#9F213D">COVID-19</font></h2>
<p><em>5.5 minute read</em></p>

<p>In any time of crisis, we can either choose to band together, or draw apart. The COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences, termed “the crisis of a generation” by our Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, is no exception. Let us examine some of these incidents to see what we can learn from them, to help us overcome future crises together.</p>

<h3 id="blaming-others-in-times-of-uncertainty">Blaming others in times of uncertainty</h3>

<p>Due to the disruptions to our lives from the pandemic, it is natural to develop feelings of resentment. The easiest targets to blame are usually those different from us, who we don’t understand as well. During circuit breaker, we saw cases of Singaporeans allowing their emotions to get the better of them and lashing out at others, or even trying to stir up unhappiness between different races.  In March and April this year, an internet user hiding behind the pseudonym ‘Sharon Liew’ posted offensive content on social media about Indian migrant workers. The owner of the account was later discovered to be a 34-year-old Malay man, who has since been handed four charges related to committing acts promoting unhappiness between different race groups.  Although the internet allows us to pretend to be whoever we want, this should never be used to promote disharmony amongst Singaporeans, or to target those different from us.</p>

<p>During this time, some have also bought into racist stereotypes, that blamed the spread of the virus on other groups of people. In April, a forum letter was published in the Chinese daily newspaper that linked the COVID-19 outbreak in foreign worker dormitories to the personal hygiene and living habits of migrant workers.  This letter was roundly condemned both by other forum writers, by netizens, and by the Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam. These incidents sparked thoughtful and challenging conversations amongst Singaporeans about issues of racism and the segregation of society, and helped many to examine the racial biases built into social structures, and into their own formation. As our society continues to have such constructive conversations about issues of race, we hope to build better understanding across communities.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this circuit breaker period has also shown us encouraging examples of Singaporeans stepping up to support and help one another.</p>

<h3 id="sharing-what-we-have-freely-with-those-less-fortunate">Sharing what we have freely with those less fortunate</h3>
<p>From February to June, we saw big and small businesses in Singapore stepping up to give away free masks, food and hand sanitizers to those in need. Big businesses like Razer, Temasek Holdings and Pizza hut stepped up to provide masks and food for Singaporeans in need, with technology firm Razer even going as far as setting up a fully automated mask production line in Singapore to supply masks.  Small business owners also did their bit to help, such as the hawker store ‘Beng Who Cooks’, which started delivering free cooked meals to the underprivileged.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/93835247_3747841691924435_4238911148084166656_n.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Individual Singaporeans too stepped up to help, with individuals giving away free masks, hand sanitizers, and organising goody-bag deliveries. In February, Mr. and Mrs. Lim used their own money to buy 6,600 masks to distribute for free to other Singaporeans,  while Ms. Tong and her husband made their own hand sanitiser and placed it in the lift of their HDB block in Serangoon.  Many other Singaporeans have since followed their lead, with hand sanitiser bottles appearing in many a HDB lift.</p>

<h3 id="bringing-singaporeans-together-to-help-one-another">Bringing Singaporeans together to help one another</h3>
<p>Although we may not have much, we can also bring people together to help. For example, Mr. Jason Cai, started an initiative called Park $2 Project (P2P) to help those ‘really in need of supplies’, by raising funds to purchase and deliver goody-bags to needy families.  Although he himself might not have had enough money, he managed to raise $10,000 in a single day to buy and deliver goody-bags containing daily necessities to 205 families.</p>

<p>Another example is Project Co-Knit with Love, where Ms. Neo Su Yin came up with a mask-strap extender to reduce the trouble her Muslim colleagues faced in removing their surgical masks worn under their tudung to eat and drink.  These mask straps extenders allowed masks to be worn over the tudung, and for the straps to not rest on the ears for extended periods, which was a problem many essential workers faced. By bringing together many knitting Singaporeans, the project was able to provide almost 5,000 mask strap extenders to over 15 essential services organisations, something Ms. Neo would not have been able to do alone.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/96362341_3805074269534510_1509161176062230528_o.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="using-our-skills-to-serve-one-another">Using our skills to serve one another</h3>
<p>Finally, we may have skills that we can use to help others, particularly during times of crisis. For example, LearnDialect.sg, a website run by Ms. Ski Yeo and Mr. Eugene Lee, put up free precautionary videos in various dialects for Chinese dialect-speaking elderly, to keep them updated on the coronavirus situation.  A Bengali-speaking NUS graduate, Ms. Sudesna Roy Chowdhury, also created a translation portal to help doctors and nurses communicate with migrant workers, an innovation that could literally save lives.  This prompted other Singaporeans to come together to create more COVID-19 medical translations, to help medical workers around the world. Sites like Meditranslate.org, founded by Singaporeans, now provide translations for up to 36 different languages, including many Chinese and Indian dialects, as well as many Southeast Asian languages.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1VR5rxF4Tg4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<h3 id="emerging-stronger-from-this-crisis-as-one-singapore">Emerging stronger from this crisis as one Singapore</h3>
<p>As we have seen above, in response to the crisis, most Singaporeans have chosen to band together, instead of drawing apart. The negative incidents above have prompted discussions and meaningful engagements between different segments of society, whether divided by race, age, or socio-economic status. The number of young Singaporeans coming forward to discuss and think about issues relating to race and privilege has been encouraging. These conversations have helped Singaporeans learn more about one another, which helps to guard against racism and false-stereotyping. To become a more empathetic and compassionate society, Singaporeans need to continue having open and challenging conversations with one another, to develop greater inter-cultural understanding.</p>

<p>In addition, Singaporeans have shown a willingness to give to and care for the least fortunate in society. Singaporeans across the board have given much more to charity this year than ever before, matching the 2019 donations total within the first 5 months of 2020. The examples of Singaporeans stepping up to serve and support one another, in big ways and small, show us that the ‘Kampung’ spirit of looking out for one another is well and alive in Singapore. With the fallout of the pandemic expected to last for many more months, we look forward to Singaporeans continuing to find ways to support one another as we seek to emerge stronger together.</p>

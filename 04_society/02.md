# Building a Multicultural Singapore
*12 minute read*

Before 1959, different ethnic groups stuck to their own enclaves as segregated by the British government. The Chinese lived downtown, the Malays in Kampong Glam and Geylang Serai, and the Indians in Serangoon and Sembawang. 

This segregation fuelled prejudices and hindered the development of mutual understanding and tolerance. “Each group clung to its own clan or dialect community for security. There was no social cohesion. We were a divided society,” former Minister for National Development S. Dhanabalan once said, during a New Year gathering for community leaders on 6 January 1989.

These feelings were eventually exploited and sparked off racial riots. In 1964, Singapore encountered one of its worst riots. That day, on 21 July, 23 people lost their lives and another 454 were injured following a scuffle between the Chinese and the Malays during a procession to celebrate the Prophet Muhammad’s birthday. The riots reignited in September, killing 13 people and injuring 106. Five years later, another racial riot broke out, leaving four dead and 80 injured.

The racially-charged riots of 1964 and 1969 reflected the ethnic tensions in multicultural Singapore, which could be easily exploited to thrust the nation into turmoil. Singapore’s founding fathers learnt that to prevent such tragedies, mutual understanding had to be built between the different ethnic groups.

Having experienced racial politics, where the majority Malay race in Malaysia was favoured, Singapore’s founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew understood the need for meritocracy and equality. Hence, when Singapore separated from Malaysia, he drummed into the Singapore population that each citizen is equal, regardless of race, language or religion. Till today, the PAP has maintained a strong stance against racial politics.

In his first speech to the United Nations General Assembly on 21 September 1965, then Foreign Minister S. Rajaratnam described Singapore as a “little United Nations in the making” where four cultures – Malay, Chinese, Indian and Western – were allowed to develop freely and equally.

The racial riots remain a stern reminder that social divisions weaken society, and that race and religion will always be potential fault lines. Singapore’s early leaders knew that they needed to build a harmonious society if Singapore were to progress. They believed in a vision of a multiracial society, where all races were treated as equals.

This belief was the key reason why they made the painful decision to separate from Malaysia in 1965. The Malaysian leaders wanted a “Malay Malaysia”, not a “Malaysian Malaysia”. They saw Singapore’s multiracial slogan as a challenge of Malay dominance.  It was a disagreement that could not be resolved.

### Maintaining Racial and Religious Harmony

The commitment to equality of races is not simply recited in our pledge; it is enshrined in Singapore’s constitution. One clear example of this is the guarantee of the right of every person to practise his religion freely. Every individual has a constitutional right to profess, practise and propagate his religion as long as such activities do not affect public order, public health or morality. A Presidential Council for Minority Rights was also established in 1970 to ensure that the rights of minorities are protected. This is to ensure that the government does not pass laws that discriminate against any race or religion. 

While the freedom to practise religion is protected, ensuring harmony between the various faiths is a critical component of a multi-religious society. To achieve this, the government introduced the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act in 1990, which encourages tolerance and moderation among different religious groups. At the same time, it also seeks to separate religion from politics, a move to guard against rising religiosity. The Act was updated in 2019 to reflect changes in the way information is spread among the population and to protect Singapore against foreign influence.

Besides putting in place safeguards to prevent discrimination against any race or religion, it is just as necessary to create bonds among people of different ethnicities. Our leaders chose a common language to unite the different ethnic groups. This was necessary in Singapore as there were multiple languages and dialects. In the past, the Chinese mainly spoke dialects such as Teochew, Hokkien and Cantonese, while the majority of Malays spoke Malay and the bulk of Indians spoke Tamil. Before independence, the education system also comprised private Chinese-, Malay- and Tamil-medium schools, which were more popular than government-run English schools. 

Hence, the government, while maintaining Malay as Singapore’s national language as Malays are constitutionally recognised as the indigenous people of Singapore, introduced English as the language of administration and instruction. This unified Singaporeans without privileging any particular cultural group while also promoting international trade and diplomacy. Singaporeans continued to retain their mother tongues as second languages, meant to provide access to their cultural heritage, thereby strengthening their values and sense of cultural belonging.

Another way the government sought to bridge gaps along racial lines was to bring the different ethnic groups together. By increasing the opportunities for them to interact, the chances of them coming to understand and accept one another’s culture and customs, and see themselves as part of one community rather than of separate groups over time, would be much higher.

The Housing Development Board’s (HDB) Ethnic Integration Policy was introduced to do just that. Aimed at preventing the formation of ethnic enclaves and promote the integration of minority groups, it specified the proportion of flats that could be owned by the various ethnic groups. This created a more balanced ethnic mix in the various housing estates.

Since then, three decades have passed and HDB estates today are a microcosm of the society at large, with a mix of residents of all races. The abundance of common spaces, including coffeeshops, fitness corners and community centres, has also made it easier for residents of different races to gather and engage in activities together.

Residents have also largely accommodated each other’s practices and customs. Cultural and religious practices such as the burning of joss paper and incense during Hungry Ghost Festival, prayer sessions at void decks during Ramadhan and the annual foot procession by Hindus during Thaipusum have also largely gained acceptance among all ethnic groups. There have also been instances of the various ethnic groups celebrating the festivals of other races. For example, they would visit the homes of friends and neighbours of different ethnic groups during national holidays like Chinese New Year, Hari Raya Puasa and Deepavali. 

### Building Common Ground Amid Diversity

While national policies and legislation have done much to promote social harmony, maintaining it needs to be done at the individual and grassroots level. 

In Singapore, the “overlapping circles” model is used when dealing with issues related to race – a concept first introduced in the 1960s by Mr S. Rajaratnam, who was then Minister for Culture. Attention was drawn to it again in 1999 by Mr Goh Chok Tong, who was then Prime Minister, as he spoke about the creation of a Singapore “tribe”. Mr Goh explained that each ethnic community is envisioned as a circle, and the goal is to maximise the overlapping areas between the circles.  The key lies in preserving the culture and customs of each racial group while creating shared beliefs and norms. This is contrary to the melting-pot approach, which would have meant absorption of the minority communities by the majority communities, he explained at the PM’s Forum at the Nanyang Technological University on 11 May 1999.

This concept of building common ground among the various races was brought into sharp focus after the 9/11 terrorist attacks by Al-Qaeda in 2001, as well as the arrest of 15 Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) members in Singapore in December 2001. The JI terrorists had planned to bomb diplomatic missions and attack nationals of Australia, Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States based in Singapore.  Mr Goh was concerned that the revelation of Singaporean Muslim involvement in the JI could affect the confidence and attitude of non-Muslim Singaporeans towards their Muslim neighbours.

In January 2016, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) released news of the arrest of 27 radicalised Bangladeshis in Singapore, who were contemplating carrying out acts of armed violence overseas.  In May of the same year, another 8 Bangladeshi men were detained for planning to stage terror attacks back in Bangladesh, and for intending to join terror group ISIS as foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq.  

Understanding that this was the act of radicalised individuals and not reflective of the whole Muslim community, many ministers came forward to speak on the incidents, with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong stating that "Radicalisation and terrorism must never take root in Singapore" , and then labour chief Chan Chun Sing urging Singaporeans to “not allow this incident to affect the strong ties we share with our fellow Muslim Singaporeans as religious harmony is the cornerstone to our unique heritage in Singapore”.  

Fortunately, efforts rooted in the concept of “overlapping circles” to promote racial and religious harmony, by creating common ideals and norms, have over the years contributed to building a foundation of mutual trust and understanding between the communities. The trust built up between the government and the Muslim community, and between the Muslims and other communities, allowed for those acts, or attempted acts, of terrorism to be discussed openly, said Mr Goh at the opening of East-West Dialogue on 16 November 2005. 

The government was hence able to act quickly to prevent Singaporeans from turning against the Muslims in the community, which could potentially have led to devastating effects on social cohesion and strained communal relations.  What the government strived to do was to frame terrorism as a national security problem that affected everyone, regardless of race or religion.

Inter-Racial Confidence Circles, or IRCCs, were formed in 2002, to act as a critical bridge between racial and religious leaders, and promote inter-faith interaction and understanding. In the event of any racial and religious conflict, the IRCCs act as first responders to quell any brewing tension among the various ethnic groups and reestablish peace.

### The Continued Need for Racial Harmony

Singapore has maintained racial and religious harmony through constant effort and vigilance. But tensions still linger and a lapse could tear open old wounds. Singapore thus has to remain on guard.

In the past decade, social tensions have continued to manifest due to racial differences, repeatedly testing the nation's ability to stay united.  (Read more about our case study on the various incidents [here](https://master.deajq4l3eosv7.amplifyapp.com/04_society/06.html#recent-racial-incidents).)

These different incidents have led to conversations in society on whether racism is built into our system, influenced by events happening in the western world. In particular, the recent George Floyd protests in the United States and around the world have once again revived discussion around issues of race and privilege, with the term “Chinese Privilege” coming into common usage.  Many locals have also come forward to share their experiences of casual and systemic racism in the recent ‘Regardless of Race’ dialogues in 2019, with some questioning the continued relevance of Special Assistance Plan (SAP) and Singapore’s Chinese-Malay-Indian-Others (CMIO) racial framework. 

These conversations have the potential to promote greater empathy and compassion amongst Singaporeans, allowing minority voices to be heard and questions asked. By listening to one another and clarifying our doubts, we can learn how to better show compassion and consideration for one another, and how to create a more equal and harmonious society. However, such conversations should be held beyond formal events, and in casual settings as well, such as in our homes, schools, and hawker centres. In particular, older Singaporeans, or those who grew up in single-race communities, may tend to have more misconceptions and biases towards other races, which need to be dispelled through frank and open conversations with those they trust.  

We should also seek to have these conversations online on social media, to prevent the formation of echo chambers. There is a tendency for social media platform algorithms to create “filter bubbles” for users, raising the possibility of echo chambers forming.  “Filter bubbles” describe a situation where the news we dislike or disagree with is automatically filtered out by the system, while echo chambers refers to situations where we have an inaccurate perception of reality because we see only or mostly news that we like or agree with. Together, this results in us only seeing news and ideas that we agree with on our social media feeds, leading to the inaccurate perception that only the view we agree with is correct.

To prevent our social media feeds and those of our friends from becoming echo chambers, we can consciously look out for and converse with people with opinions different from ours, and share articles or commentaries from a range of perspectives. We should also beware of accounts spreading sensational fake news by those who seek to de-stabilise our society. Calling out the inaccuracies in these posts and having conversations with those who share them is one way of protecting this unity we enjoy as a society. 

After all, “We are not completely colour-blind, and this makes a difference. It will influence our thinking and choices, either consciously or unconsciously,” said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, in a speech on multiculturalism at a PA Kopi Talk on 23 September 2017, shortly after Madam Halimah Yacob was sworn in as Singapore’s first Malay president in 47 years. Singapore, he said, "continues to require guide-ropes and guard-rails to prevent us from falling off along the way.”

> “But I say to you: Here we make the model multiracial society. This is not a country that belongs to any single community: it belongs to all of us.” – Founding Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, during a scholarship award ceremony at Sree Narayana Mission on 12 September 1965.

The national pledge echoes not just words recited by heart but the belief upon which Singapore was founded more than 50 years ago. It was a vision that Singapore’s founding fathers fought for, after the country separated from Malaysia – a Singapore for Singaporeans, regardless of race, language or religion.

After all, Singapore’s forefathers hailed from the southern provinces of China, Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Ceylon and the Middle East. They could not be more different. Not just in looks, but they also held diverse beliefs, and their customs and social behaviours varied. Most had no prior interactions with people of other races. But they had a common vision: a better life. 

Singapore’s first leaders believed in creating a society where people of different races, faiths and languages could live together in harmony. The creation of a harmonious society was a gradual process through conscious education, inculcation of shared values and attitudes, as well as the creation of common spaces and opportunities.

Through its policies, the government has made room for the different races to interact and learn from one another. It has forged a shared identity, initially through tangible means such as the creation of national symbols and public housing, and later a common culture through the exchange of food and music, the arts and the English language. The shared identity has given Singapore the reputation of being a multiracial, meritocratic nation – one that has gained the admiration of people abroad. 

After Madam Halimah Yacob was sworn in as Singapore’s first Malay president in 47 years in 2017, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong posted a photo on Instagram of himself, President Halimah and Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon. A Chinese, Malay and Indian, all in the same photo. Just a few days later, during the F1 night race, an international visitor from Brazil saw the picture and commented that it was amazing that different races lived in such harmony in Singapore, and that he could not imagine it happening anywhere else.

Making reference to this incident in his speech on multiculturalism on 23 September 2017, during a People’s Association (PA) event “Kopi Talk”, PM Lee said that this makes us Singaporean. But he noted that while Singapore has made progress, it has not arrived at an ideal state of accepting people of a different race.

“There is nothing natural about where we are – multiracial, multi-religious, tolerant and progressive. We made it happen, and we have got to protect it, nurture it, preserve it, and never break it,” he said. [2]

Recent incidents such as the “brownface” controversy involving an E-Pay advertisement and a rap video that chastised it are reminders that race relations remain a thorny and emotive issue, and that racial harmony is a work in progress. [3]

As society advances, new fault lines will emerge. The influx of new immigrants may give rise to simmering local-foreign tensions , while the widening gap between the rich and poor could potentially divide the community along class lines. Other issues include Singapore’s low fertility rate and ageing population, a growing number of inter-ethnic and transnational marriages, changing views about the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community. Indeed, the work to keep Singaporeans as one people is never done.

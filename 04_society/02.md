# Building a Multicultural Singapore
*12 minute read*

Singapore’s location on the crossroads of trade between the East and West, has drawn a diverse mix of people here, for hundreds of years. Our multi-racial and multi-religious identity began long before we attained independence as a nation. 

Interactions between the different ethnic groups, however, were limited under British rule. The British government had assigned separate areas for the different communities: the Chinese downtown, the Malays in Kampong Glam and Geylang Serai, and the Indians in Serangoon and Sembawang. 

This segregation hindered the development of mutual understanding and trust between communities. “Each group clung to its own clan or dialect community for security. There was no social cohesion. We were a divided society,” former Minister for National Development S. Dhanabalan once said, during a New Year gathering for community leaders on 6 January 1989.

In 1964, Singapore encountered one of its worst riots. That day, on 21 July, 23 people lost their lives and another 454 were injured following a scuffle between the Chinese and the Malays during a procession to celebrate the Prophet Muhammad’s birthday. The riots reignited in September, killing 13 people and injuring 106. Five years later, another racial riot broke out, leaving four dead and 80 injured.

The racially-charged riots of 1964 and 1969 showed how easily ethnic tensions could be exploited to thrust the nation into turmoil. Singapore’s early leaders recognised that race and religion were potential fault lines that had to be addressed, if Singapore were to progress.

This issue was the key reason why they made the painful decision to separate from Malaysia in 1965. The Malaysian leaders wanted a “Malay Malaysia”, not a “Malaysian Malaysia”. They saw Singapore’s multiracial slogan as a challenge to Malay dominance. It was a disagreement that could not be resolved.

Having experienced racial politics, where the majority Malay race in Malaysia was favoured, Singapore’s founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew understood the need for meritocracy and equality. When Singapore separated from Malaysia, our leaders drummed into Singaporeans that each citizen is equal, regardless of race, language or religion.

In his first speech to the United Nations General Assembly on 21 September 1965, then Foreign Minister S. Rajaratnam described Singapore as a “little United Nations in the making” where four cultures – Malay, Chinese, Indian and Western – were allowed to develop freely and equally.

### Maintaining Racial and Religious Harmony

The commitment to equality of races is not simply recited in our pledge; it is enshrined in our Constitution, which states that no citizen has more or less rights than another citizen. Singapore is also a secular state which does not favour any religion, nor allow religious preferences to dictate the affairs of the state, whether in the enactment of laws or in the areas of public policies.

A Presidential Council for Minority Rights was established to safeguard the rights of minorities and to ensure that the government does not pass laws that discriminate against any race or religion.

And while the freedom to practise religion is protected, the government introduced the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act in 1990 to encourage tolerance and moderation among different religious groups, and to guard against rising religiosity. The Act was updated in 2019 	to reflect changes in the way information is spread among the population and to protect Singapore against foreign influence.

Besides safeguards against discrimination, measures were also taken to form bonds between people of different ethnicities. Our leaders chose a common language to unite the different ethnic groups. This was necessary in Singapore as there were multiple languages and dialects. In the past, the Chinese mainly spoke dialects such as Teochew, Hokkien and Cantonese, while the majority of Malays spoke Malay and the bulk of Indians spoke Tamil. Before independence, the education system also comprised private Chinese-, Malay- and Tamil-medium schools, which were more popular than government-run English schools.

Hence, the government, while maintaining Malay as Singapore’s national language as Malays are constitutionally recognised as the indigenous people of Singapore, introduced English as the language of administration and instruction. This unified Singaporeans without privileging any particular cultural group while also promoting international trade and diplomacy. Singaporeans continued to retain their mother tongues as second languages, to access their cultural heritage and strengthen their values and sense of cultural belonging.

Another way the government sought to bridge gaps along racial lines was to increase opportunities for interaction and familiarity with one another’s ways and customs, so that Singaporeans see themselves as part of a larger community of diverse people.

The Housing Development Board’s (HDB) Ethnic Integration Policy was introduced to do just that. Aimed at preventing the formation of ethnic enclaves and to promote the integration of minority groups, it specified the proportion of flats that could be owned by the various ethnic groups. This created a more balanced ethnic mix in the various housing estates.

Since then, three decades have passed and HDB estates today are a microcosm of the society at large, with a mix of residents of all races. The abundance of common spaces, including coffeeshops, fitness corners and community centres, has also made it easier for residents of different races to gather and engage in activities together.

Residents have also largely accommodated each other’s practices and customs. Cultural and religious practices such as the burning of joss paper and incense during Hungry Ghost Festival, prayer sessions at void decks during Ramadhan and the annual foot procession by Hindus during Thaipusum have largely gained acceptance among all ethnic groups. There have also been instances of the various ethnic groups celebrating the festivals of other races. For example, they would visit the homes of friends and neighbours of different ethnic groups during national holidays like Chinese New Year, Hari Raya Puasa and Deepavali.

### Building Common Ground Amid Diversity

While national policies and legislation have done much to promote social harmony, it is also being maintained at the individual and grassroots level.

Singapore uses the “overlapping circles” model to deal with issues related to race – a concept first introduced in the 1960s by Mr S. Rajaratnam, who was then Minister for Culture. In 1999, Mr Goh Chok Tong, who was then Prime Minister, referred to it as he spoke about the creation of a Singapore “tribe”. Mr Goh explained that each ethnic community is envisioned as a circle, and the goal is to maximise the overlapping areas between the circles. The key lies in preserving the culture and customs of each racial group while creating shared beliefs and norms. 

This is contrary to the melting-pot approach, which would have meant absorption of the minority communities by the majority communities, he explained at the PM’s Forum at the Nanyang Technological University on 11 May 1999.

The efforts to promote racial and religious harmony, by building common ideals and norms in the “overlapping circles” as well as having room for diversity, have contributed, over the years, to a foundation of mutual trust and understanding between the communities. 

This was most clearly seen during the arrest of 15 Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) members in Singapore in December 2001. Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks by Al-Qaeda in the United States in September 2001, the JI terrorists had planned to bomb diplomatic missions and attack nationals of Australia, Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States based in Singapore.

Mr Goh was concerned that the revelation of Singaporean Muslim involvement in the JI could affect the confidence and attitude of non-Muslim Singaporeans towards their Muslim neighbours. 
But the trust built up between the government and the Muslim community, and between the Muslims and other communities, allowed for those acts, or attempted acts, of terrorism to be discussed openly, said Mr Goh at the opening of East-West Dialogue on 16 November 2005.

In the aftermath of the JI arrests, Inter-Racial Confidence Circles, or IRCCs, were formed in 2002, to act as a critical bridge between racial and religious leaders, and promote inter-faith interaction and understanding. In the event of any racial and religious conflict, the IRCCs act as first responders to quell any brewing tension among the various ethnic groups and reestablish peace.

The key value of the IRCC network is “to make sure that in times of peace, we build relationships, trust and confidence. This will create a safety net for Singapore.” said Mr Vivien Balakrishnan in 2008, then-Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports.

On January 2016, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) released news of the arrest of 27 radicalised Bangladeshis in Singapore, who were contemplating carrying out acts of armed violence overseas. In May of the same year, another 8 Bangladeshi men were detained for planning to stage terror attacks back in Bangladesh, and for intending to join terror group ISIS as foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq.

Many ministers came forward to speak on the incidents, including then labour chief Chan Chun Sing who urged Singaporeans “not allow this incident to affect the strong ties we share with our fellow Muslim Singaporeans as religious harmony is the cornerstone to our unique heritage in Singapore”.

Understanding that this was the act of radicalised individuals and not reflective of the whole Muslim community, Singaporeans were aligned with the government approach in treating terrorism as a national security problem that affected everyone, regardless of race or religion.

The government was therefore able to act quickly to prevent Singaporeans from turning against the Muslims in the community, which could potentially have led to devastating effects on social cohesion and strained communal relations.

### The Continued Need for Racial Harmony

Singapore has adopted social resilience as a key strategy against terrorism and domestic conflict because race and religion are dangerous fault lines. Reducing racial and religious tension through cooperation and understanding between communities is critical in preventing future acts of violence in Singapore.

But a lapse could tear open old wounds. Singapore, therefore, remains ever vigilant in monitoring tensions from racial differences, taking proactive steps to safeguard the nation’s ability to stay united.

In recent years, some events have led to conversations in society on whether racism is built into our system. In particular, the recent George Floyd protests in the United States revived discussion around issues of race and privilege, with the term “Chinese Privilege” coming into common usage. Many locals have also come forward to share their experiences of casual and systemic racism in the recent ‘Regardless of Race’ dialogues in 2019, with some questioning the continued relevance of Special Assistance Plan (SAP) and Singapore’s Chinese-Malay-Indian-Others (CMIO) racial framework.

These conversations have the potential to promote greater empathy and compassion amongst Singaporeans, allowing minority voices to be heard and questions asked. By listening to one another and clarifying our doubts, we learn how to better show compassion and consideration for one another, and how to create a more equal and harmonious society. 

Such conversations are also needed in casual settings as well as formal events, in our homes, schools, and hawker centres. In particular, older Singaporeans, or those who grew up in single-race communities, may have more misconceptions and biases towards other races, which need to be dispelled through frank and open conversations with those they trust.

Online, there is a tendency for social media platform algorithms to create “filter bubbles” for users where information we dislike or disagree with is automatically filtered out. This increases the risks of “echo chambers” forming, where we have an inaccurate perception of reality, because we see only or mostly news that we like or agree with. Our social media feeds could mislead us into thinking only our view is right.

To prevent our social media feeds and those of our friends from becoming echo chambers, we need to consciously look out for people with opinions different from our own to converse with them, and share articles or commentaries from a range of perspectives. We need to also be aware of accounts that spread fake news or cause hate, by those who seek to de-stabilise our society. Calling out the inaccuracies in these posts and having conversations with those who share them, helps protect the unity we enjoy as a society.

“We are not completely colour-blind, and this makes a difference. It will influence our thinking and choices, either consciously or unconsciously,” said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, in a speech on multiculturalism at a PA Kopi Talk on 23 September 2017, shortly after Madam Halimah Yacob was sworn in as Singapore’s first Malay president in 47 years. Singapore, he said, “continues to require guide-ropes and guard-rails to prevent us from falling off along the way.”

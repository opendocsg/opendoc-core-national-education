# Building a Multicultural Singapore

## Introduction

Before 1959, different ethnic groups stuck to their own enclaves as segregated by the British government. The Chinese lived downtown, the Malays in Kampong Glam and Geylang Serai, and the Indians in Serangoon and Sembawang. 

This segregation fuelled prejudices and hindered the development of mutual understanding and tolerance. “Each group clung to its own clan or dialect community for security. There was no social cohesion. We were a divided society,” former Minister for National Development S. Dhanabalan once said, during a New Year gathering for community leaders on 6 January 1989. 

These feelings were eventually exploited and sparked off racial riots. In 1964, Singapore encountered one of its worst riots. That day, on 21 July, 23 people lost their lives and another 454 were injured following a scuffle between the Chinese and the Malays during a procession to celebrate the Prophet Muhammad’s birthday. The riots reignited in September, killing 13 people and injuring 106.   Five years later, another racial riot broke out, leaving four dead and 80 injured.

## Case study: Racial riots (1964 and 1969)

On 21 July 1964, some 20,000 Malays gathered at the Padang for a procession to celebrate Prophet Muhammad’s birthday. Singing and waving banners, the celebrants were just passing Kampong Soo Poo when a glass bottle was hurled into the crowd, hitting someone on the head.

Angry exchanges between the marching Malays and the Chinese bystanders ensued, which soon escalated into violence with more bottles being hurled and punches thrown. As word of the riot spread, more joined in, resulting in fights breaking out across the island. The entire police force was activated and the armed forces mobilised. Tear gas was used to break up fights and an islandwide curfew was imposed.  

The person who threw the bottle was never identified but the Singapore government eventually traced the incident to Malay UMNO activists led by then UMNO secretary-general Ja’afar Albar. Prior to the riots, Ja’afar Albar had started a campaign accusing the People’s Action Party (PAP) government of depriving the Malays in Singapore of the special rights given to their Malaysian counterparts.

“I believe the riot was planned; it did not start spontaneously. They were very smart to choose a religious procession so that if we had stopped it, we would be called anti-Muslim. The inflammatory communal and racial speeches made by Malaysian UMNO leaders worked up Malay sentiments in Singapore,” said Mr Othman Wok in Men In White, the 2010 book on the history of the PAP. Mr Othman was Minister for Social Affairs when the riots happened.  

It took 17 days for the situation to stabilise, during which Goodwill Committees were set up across all 51 constituencies at the time, consisting of community leaders of all races. They were tasked to restore harmony amongst the races by listening to and addressing the concerns of residents.  Peace Committees were also formed in the areas hardest hit by the riots to counter rumours.  In all, 23 people lost their lives and another 454 were injured.

However, peace was short-lived. Widespread communal riots broke out between the Malays and Chinese a month later, after the mysterious killing of a Malay trishaw rider in Geylang Serai. 

Curfews were again imposed, and the police and military mobilised. On 14 September, 12 days later, calm was established. By then, 13 people had died and another 106 were injured.
The target was not just the Singapore Chinese, but also the Malay PAP leaders to pressure them into endorsing the primacy of Malays. But Mr Othman and his Malay comrades stood firm and kept the dream of a multiracial society alive. 

In 1969, riots between Malays and Chinese erupted again, spilling over to Singapore from Kuala Lumpur (KL) where fighting had broken out as a result of unhappiness surrounding the general elections results and rumours pertaining to the Chinese and Malays.

The election was preceded by outbreaks of racial incidents that created a tense atmosphere. A Malay political worker had been killed by a Chinese gang in Penang, while a Chinese youth was shot and killed by police in Kuala Lumpur.  While election day passed without incident, the parade by winning opposition parties DAP and Gerakan were alleged to be highly provocative, with non-Malays taunting the Malays. They were seen as an attack on Malay supremacy, though the overall election results still favoured the Malay. 

On 13 May, just before UMNO’s procession, fist fights broke out in Setapak, in KL between a group of Malays and Chinese bystanders who taunted them, which escalated into bottle and stone throwing. Violence soon spread across the city and across the border into Singapore. 

On 31 May, fuelled by rumours of the clash, Malay mobs and Chinese triads in Singapore began attacking one another. The seven-day clashes left four people dead and some 80 injured. However, the government was quick to contain the riots before they could spread.  The Internal Security Department (ISD) stepped in to quash the conflicts together with the police.

The racially-charged riots of 1964 and 1969 reflected the ethnic tensions in multicultural Singapore, which could be easily exploited to thrust the nation into turmoil. Singapore’s founding fathers learnt that to prevent such tragedies, mutual understanding had to be built between the different ethnic groups.

Having experienced racial politics, where the majority Malay race in Malaysia was favoured, Singapore’s founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew understood the need for meritocracy and equality. Hence, when Singapore separated from Malaysia, he drummed into the Singapore population that each citizen is equal, regardless of race, language or religion. Till today, the PAP has maintained a strong stance against racial politics. 

In his first speech to the United Nations General Assembly on 21 September 1965, then Foreign Minister S. Rajaratnam described Singapore as a “little United Nations in the making” where four cultures – Malay, Chinese, Indian and Western – were allowed to develop freely and equally.

“In a multiracial society one soon learns that no one people has a monopoly of wisdom and that one’s culture is not without flaws. This not only breeds tolerance for different viewpoints but also a readiness to learn and borrow from the accumulated wisdom of other people, he said.

“These are, we have discovered, attitudes of mind essential for the smooth and constructive development of a multi-racial and multi-cultural society.” 

-----

The racial riots remain a stern reminder that social divisions weaken society, and that race and religion will always be potential fault lines. Singapore’s early leaders knew that they needed to build a harmonious society if Singapore were to progress. They believed in a vision of a multiracial society, where all races were treated as equals.

This belief was the key reason why they made the painful decision to separate from Malaysia in 1965. The Malaysian leaders wanted a “Malay Malaysia”, not a “Malaysian Malaysia”. They saw Singapore’s multiracial slogan as a challenge of Malay dominance.  It was a disagreement that could not be resolved.

“They maintained the supremacy of the Malay race. We said all right fine, give us a deadline, after how many years can we become equal. 20 years? Why don't you stipulate it? They said no, never. That was the root of the problem,” said former president S.R. Nathan in the Channel NewsAsia (CNA) documentary Days of Rage, which aired in January 2014. 

## Maintaining Racial and Religious Harmony

The commitment to equality of races is not simply recited in our pledge; it is enshrined in Singapore’s constitution. One clear example of this is the guarantee of the right of every person to practise his religion freely. Every individual has a constitutional right to profess, practise and propagate his religion as long as such activities do not affect public order, public health or morality. A Presidential Council for Minority Rights was also established in 1970 to ensure that the rights of minorities are protected. This is to ensure that the government does not pass laws that discriminate against any race or religion. 

While the freedom to practise religion is protected, ensuring harmony between the various faiths is a critical component of a multi-religious society. To achieve this, the government introduced the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act in 1990, which encourages tolerance and moderation among different religious groups. At the same time, it also seeks to separate religion from politics, a move to guard against rising religiosity. The Act was updated in 2019 to reflect changes in the way information is spread among the population and to protect Singapore against foreign influence. 

Besides putting in place safeguards to prevent discrimination against any race or religion, it is just as necessary to create bonds among people of different ethnicities. Our leaders chose a common language to unite the different ethnic groups. This was necessary in Singapore as there were multiple languages and dialects. In the past, the Chinese mainly spoke dialects such as Teochew, Hokkien and Cantonese, while the majority of Malays spoke Malay and the bulk of Indians spoke Tamil. Before independence, the education system also comprised private Chinese-, Malay- and Tamil-medium schools, which were more popular than government-run English schools. 

Hence, the government, while maintaining Malay as Singapore’s national language as Malays are constitutionally recognised as the indigenous people of Singapore, introduced English as the language of administration and instruction. This unified Singaporeans without privileging any particular cultural group while also promoting international trade and diplomacy. Singaporeans continued to retain their mother tongues as second languages, meant to provide access to their cultural heritage, thereby strengthening their values and sense of cultural belonging. 

Another way the government sought to bridge gaps along racial lines was to bring the different ethnic groups together. By increasing the opportunities for them to interact, the chances of them coming to understand and accept one another’s culture and customs, and see themselves as part of one community rather than of separate groups over time, would be much higher.

The Housing Development Board’s (HDB) Ethnic Integration Policy was introduced to do just that. Aimed at preventing the formation of ethnic enclaves and promote the integration of minority groups, it specified the proportion of flats that could be owned by the various ethnic groups. This created a more balanced ethnic mix in the various housing estates.

## Case study: HDB Ethnic Integration Policy (1989)

In the 1980s, more than 20 years after HDB flats were introduced, there were signs that segregation among the races had once again started to take root. Malay households made up more than 30 per cent of the estate population in Bedok and Tampines while the Chinese formed more than 90 per cent of the households in Hougang.  This was made worse by a growing resale market for HDB flats, where families tended to buy flats in areas with more residents of their own race.

Then Minister for National Development S. Dhanabalan warned that it would be “unthinkable” for Singapore to regress to the days before independence, when a certain place was seen as belonging to a certain ethnic or dialect group.

“Living in separate enclaves, the different races would find fewer opportunities to intermingle and understand each other. MPs and community leaders will develop narrow views of society interest. The enclaves will become the seedbeds for communal agitation,” he said at a New Year gathering for community leaders on 6 January 1989. 

Uprooting residents to break up the enclaves, like how it was done through a massive resettlement exercise in the 1960s, was not a viable option. People could still move to live close to others of the same race, as the reestablishment of enclaves at certain estates had shown. Hence, in 1989, the Ethnic Integration Policy was introduced.

Mr Dhanabalan, in introducing the policy to Parliament on 16 February 1989, called it a “open and clear policy”. The policy’s enforceable limits will ensure that the ethnic proportions are kept, which will prevent the races from “regrouping” even in the long run. 

The policy stipulated that the proportion of flats in each neighbourhood for Malays, Chinese, Indians and other minority groups would be 22 per cent, 84 per cent and 10 per cent respectively. The allowable proportion of flats in each block was set at 25 per cent for Malays, 87 per cent for Chinese and 13 per cent for Indians and other races.

Since then, three decades have passed and HDB estates today are a microcosm of the society at large, with a mix of residents of all races. The abundance of common spaces, including coffeeshops, fitness corners and community centres, has also made it easier for residents of different races to gather and engage in activities together.

Residents have also largely accommodated each other’s practices and customs. Cultural and religious practices such as the burning of joss paper and incense during Hungry Ghost Festival, prayer sessions at void decks during Ramadhan and the annual foot procession by Hindus during Thaipusum have also largely gained acceptance among all ethnic groups. There have also been instances of the various ethnic groups celebrating the festivals of other races. For example, they would visit the homes of friends and neighbours of different ethnic groups during national holidays like Chinese New Year, Hari Raya Puasa and Deepavali. 

## Building Common Ground Amid Diversity

While national policies and legislation have done much to promote social harmony, maintaining it needs to be done at the individual and grassroots level. 

In Singapore, the “overlapping circles” model is used when dealing with issues related to race – a concept first introduced in the 1960s by Mr S. Rajaratnam, who was then Minister for Culture. Attention was drawn to it again in 1999 by Mr Goh Chok Tong, who was then Prime Minister, as he spoke about the creation of a Singapore “tribe”. Mr Goh explained that each ethnic community is envisioned as a circle, and the goal is to maximise the overlapping areas between the circles.  The key lies in preserving the culture and customs of each racial group while creating shared beliefs and norms. This is contrary to the melting-pot approach, which would have meant absorption of the minority communities by the majority communities, he explained at the PM’s Forum at the Nanyang Technological University on 11 May 1999. 
 
This concept of building common ground among the various races was brought into sharp focus after the 9/11 terrorist attacks by Al-Qaeda in 2001, as well as the arrest of 15 Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) members in Singapore in December 2001. The JI terrorists had planned to bomb diplomatic missions and attack nationals of Australia, Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States based in Singapore.  Mr Goh was concerned that the revelation of Singaporean Muslim involvement in the JI could affect the confidence and attitude of non-Muslim Singaporeans towards their Muslim neighbours.

Fortunately, efforts rooted in the concept of “overlapping circles” to promote racial and religious harmony, by creating common ideals and norms, have over the years contributed to building a foundation of mutual trust and understanding between the communities. The trust built up between the government and the Muslim community, and between the Muslims and other communities, allowed for those acts, or attempted acts, of terrorism to be discussed openly, said Mr Goh at the opening of East-West Dialogue on 16 November 2005. 

The government was hence able to act quickly to prevent Singaporeans from turning against the Muslims in the community, which could potentially have led to devastating effects on social cohesion and strained communal relations.  What the government strived to do was to frame terrorism as a national security problem that affected everyone, regardless of race or religion.

Inter-Racial Confidence Circles, or IRCCs, were formed in 2002, to act as a critical bridge between racial and religious leaders, and promote inter-faith interaction and understanding. In the event of any racial and religious conflict, the IRCCs act as first responders to quell any brewing tension among the various ethnic groups and reestablish peace.

## Case study: Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circle

After the arrest of 15 Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) members in Singapore in December 2001, there were jitters in the community. The Malay/Muslim community was worried that they would be discriminated against, while non-Muslims grew suspicious of their Muslim neighbours.

This growing distrust threatened to disrupt Singapore’s multiracial, multi-religious society, prompting then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong to promote open and public dialogues. He believed that the best way to address pockets of disquiet within society was for the community itself to take action.

“To strengthen race and religious relations, every community in Singapore must look within itself, and prevent developments that pull the community away from the larger Singapore society. We must also reach outside our own communities, and build bonds of confidence, friendship and trust with others,” he said, at one such dialogue with young Malay/Muslim professionals on 2 February 2002. 

Apart from encouraging every community to speak up against extremist voices, weed out deviant teachings and remove practices that reduce common space between the races, the government also formed Inter-Racial Confidence Circles, or IRCCs, in 2002.

They served as important bridges for leaders of the various racial and religious communities to interact through networking sessions and inter-faith dialogues and visits. 

Renamed Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles in 2007, IRCCs continue to act as peacekeepers. Besides promoting inter-faith interaction and understanding, they also respond quickly to racial and religious tensions by addressing ground concerns, quashing rumours and preserving solidarity among members.

IRCCs have also had to arbitrate on the use of common spaces by religious organisations like mosques or temples. One example was when a fire-walking festival used the common area outside a Hindu temple. The IRCCs were involved during the planning stages to find ways to minimise disruption to residents and businesses. 
Kembangan-Chai Chee IRCC chairman Fazlur Rahman noted that religious leaders already have sufficient platforms to communicate with each other. “What we need now are more ground-up initiatives where members of the community from various religious groups, especially the youth, come forward.” 

Indeed, 29-year-old librarian Joti Upadhya, who attended the National IRCC Convention 2018, said: “Usually we need to have events to discuss such issues (on race and religion). But we need to go beyond that. We should discuss them with our friends during lunches or gatherings.”

As Mr Goh said: “Each community does not exist in isolation, but as a member of the larger society. Its success and progress depend not only on its own efforts, but also on how well it gets along with the other communities, and how well we all manage to work together as a nation.” 

## Conclusion

Singapore has maintained racial and religious harmony through constant effort and vigilance. But tensions still linger and a lapse could tear open old wounds. Singapore thus has to remain on guard.

In the past decade, social tensions have continued to manifest due to racial differences, repeatedly testing the nation's ability to stay united.
In 2012, Singaporean Amy Cheong made the headlines after she launched a racist tirade against Malays and their wedding practices. She disparaged Malays for holding weddings at void decks and mocked their divorce rate. She was promptly fired from work and left Singapore after being shamed and threatened by netizens.  A police report was made against her, but she was let off with a stern warning after issuing a public apology. 

In 2016, a couple running the socio-political website, The Real Singapore, was charged for publishing incendiary fake news. One particular article about a Filipino's fictitious complaints over Thaipusam fanned resentment against the Pinoy community here.  Ai Takagi and Yang Kaiheng, who were jailed for 10 months and eight months respectively, published the articles as early as 2013. Their site has since been shut down. 

Thoughtless actions can also trigger incidents. In February 2018, rumours began to spread online that food stall Green Delights was violating its Halal status after an ambiguous photo was shared online.  The viral photo showed a Halal sticker being placed alongside a poster advertising pork belly rice on a pillar when, in fact, the poster belonged to an adjacent stall. Business dropped by as much as 20 per cent as a result. 

Likewise, the “Brownface” incident in 2019 showed that paying close attention to racial sensitivities remains critical. In an advertisement, Chinese actor Dennis Chew dressed up as characters of different races, including as a Malay woman and an Indian man in office wear. His skin was also darkened as part of the get-up. Some Singaporeans took offence to it, calling the move racist. Others believed there was no malice behind the advertisement.  A pair of local internet personalities Preeti Nair and her brother Subhas then escalated the issue by making an expletive-ridden video that mocked the original advertisement. The Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) investigated the advertisement and found that while it had not breached any law, it was done in poor taste.  The involved parties, including the actor and creative agency, all issued apologies.  Ms Nair and her brother were also warned by the Ministry of Home Affairs after they apologised for their act. 

But there have also been incidents involving race that can be resolved amiably. One such case involved local online influencer Sheena Phua, who came under fire in 2019 after she made an Instagram post that called two men wearing turbans “huge obstructions” to her view at the Singapore Grand Prix. Her comment was seen as mocking the Sikhs.  

However, the Sikh community's reaction was gracious. They invited her on an informal tour around Central Sikh Temple, where she got to learn about the culture. Besides issuing apologies, she also released photos of the tour and thanked the Sikh community for its kindness. 
Each of these examples shows that keeping Singapore a multiracial and multicultural society remains a work in progress. Much has been achieved but more can be done to encourage mutual understanding among the population.

“We are not completely colour-blind, and this makes a difference. It will influence our thinking and choices, either consciously or unconsciously,” said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, in a speech on multiculturalism at a PA Kopi Talk on 23 September 2017, shortly after Madam Halimah Yacob was sworn in as Singapore’s first Malay president in 47 years. Singapore, he said, continues to require guide-ropes and guard-rails to prevent us from falling off along the way.”

“It is about having the honesty to recognise that our multiracialism is not yet perfect, but having the courage and determination to take pragmatic steps to get there, step by step,” he said.

“That is how we will continue to expand our common space, strengthen trust, and become one people, one nation, one Singapore.”

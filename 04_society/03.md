# Creating a Shared Identity as Singaporeans
*11 minute read*

For former Deputy Prime Minister Dr Toh Chin Chye, the national flag, crest and anthem were more than just symbols for a newly independent Singapore.

Still recovering from the communal tensions and racial riots of the 1950s and 60s, Singapore needed to forge a common identity and sense of belonging among its people. These symbols were to help forge a sense of unity, shared purpose and, over time, a common destiny to which all Singaporeans could strive towards. However, unlike other nations which had a far longer history to draw upon to create a shared identity, Singapore could not afford the time to let the process develop naturally.

The national anthem was the first symbol to be created. “Majulah Singapura”, or Onward Singapore in English, was composed in 1958 by Singapore composer Zubir Said. The song was originally commissioned by the City Council of Singapore in 1958 as an official song for the council’s function. But after Singapore attained self-governance in 1959, a shortened and more upbeat version was made the country’s national anthem, as a musical expression of Singapore’s identity as a nation. Its melody and lyrics echoed the enduring hope and spirit of Singaporeans for progress. It also promoted the coming together of Singaporeans to work towards a common goal: a better future.

According to Dr Toh, Majulah Singapura was chosen for its patriotic lyrics that expressed the aspirations of the people of Singapore. He added that the lyrics of the national anthem were specifically written in Malay as it is an indigenous language of the region and would appeal to all races.


Our national flag was next created and unveiled on 3 Dec 1959. “The political purpose was to have a flag around which the three different communities of Singapore can rally around. That is important,” said Dr Toh, in an interview with the National Archives of Singapore on 23 August 1989. He was tasked to create the symbols back in 1959 when Singapore achieved self-governance. (Listen to the rest of his interview [here](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/oral_history_interviews/record-details/9c06f865-115f-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad).)

He studied the flags of other countries with the intention of creating something unique to Singapore. He eventually settled on the red and white design, with the use of five stars to represent the values of democracy, peace, progress, equality and justice.

Red was chosen because it symbolised prosperity and happiness, while white – formed when all seven colours of the rainbow are combined – was chosen to symbolise the unity of the different races. The crescent moon, which represents Singapore as a new nation, was added later because Dr Toh wanted to “remove any apprehension that we were building a Chinese state”. After all, “there are also five stars on the flag of the People’s Republic of China”, he said.

The idea of a pledge was also mooted as a way to inculcate national consciousness and patriotism in schools. Author of the Singapore pledge, Mr S. Rajaratnam, who was Minister for Foreign Affairs at the time, believed that differences in language, race and religion were potentially divisive. Hence, he made use of the pledge to emphasise that these differences could be overcome if Singaporeans were united in their commitment to the country.

The fundamentals of Singapore’s multicultural society were never to forget differences, but rather to acknowledge them, set them aside and go beyond them. This distinction is clear during the creation of the pledge.

After three drafts and multiple revisions, the Singapore pledge was finalised. On 24 August 1966, about 500,000 students at all 529 government and government-aided schools held the first daily recitation of the pledge of allegiance before the national flag.

### Forging a National Identity

While symbols may help Singaporeans identify with the country, it does not mean that it resulted in the instant creation of a national identity. Forging a national identity required time and a conscious effort to allow people opportunities to interact and form bonds with one other. They also need to feel that they had a tangible stake in the country’s development and progress.

One of the ways this was done was through the housing scheme introduced to encourage home ownership among Singaporeans. In February 1964, the government introduced the Home Ownership for the People Scheme to give citizens a tangible asset in the country and a stake in nation-building. Today, about 80 per cent of the population live in Housing & Development Board (HDB) flats, and a vast majority own their flats. 

A big part of forging a common identity is also in the intangible aspects of culture that people share. The experience of growing up in Singapore is a unique one that forms and shapes shared experiences that Singaporeans can relate to.

Other aspects such as the arts and music as part of our identity was also considered to help create a Singaporean culture in the 1990s. Led by then-Acting Minister for the Arts George Yeo, Singapore built The Esplanade and new museums, as well as set up the National Arts Council.

Over the years, we have developed a distinctly Singaporean cultural experience, drawing from our richness and diversity from our roots as a migrant nation. Many aspects of our culture, from language to food today are a rich amalgamation and hybrid of Chinese, Malay, Indian, European cultures and so on. One of these examples is our hawker culture, which is on UNESCO’s  Intangible Cultural Heritage list.

Another example of what is uniquely Singaporean is the evolution and use of a local English slang. Singlish, as it is called, clearly distinguishes a Singaporean Chinese from a Chinese person from China – it is a mark of local culture. After all, it is a mix of the various cultures in Singapore.

Singlish grammar mirrors that of Malay, by doing away with most prepositions, verb conjugations, and plural words, while its vocabulary reflects the broad range of the country’s immigrant roots. It borrows from Malay, Hokkien, Cantonese, Mandarin and other Chinese languages, as well as Tamil from southern India.

A national identity acts as a bulwark against forces that may seek to fracture society. It pulls Singaporeans together in a time of crisis instead of fragmenting into separate ethnic groups. 

This was the concern that Mr Goh Chok Tong, then Prime Minister, posed during a parliamentary debate on 5 May 1999: “In a crunch, where the interests of the tribe and the state diverge, can we be sure that the sense of belonging to a state will be stronger than the primordial instinct of belonging to a tribe?”

### Standing in Solidarity

And indeed, there are many times when we have stood together as a nation in solidarity, from moments of grief, to moments of pride.

On 23 March 2015, Singapore’s founding father and first Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, passed away. Over a week, hundreds of thousands paid their last respects at the Istana and 18 community tribute centres across the island. Queues snaked for miles, with people braving the blazing sun for eight hours or more at times to say their last goodbyes. Singaporeans took care of one other as they waited to pay their respects, handing out paper fans, food and drinks paid for from their own pockets. In grief, Singaporeans showed solidarity.

Another occasion where we displayed solidarity as Singaporeans was the 2015 Southeast Asian (SEA) Games. It was to be the sixth time that our national anthem Majulah Singapura sounded through the OCBC Aquatic Centre as Singapore’s swimmers mounted the podium again, this time after winning the women’s 4x200m freestyle relay. However, the PA system crackled and died midway through the national anthem. Undeterred, Singaporeans in the stands picked up from where the PA system left off, singing even louder, till the end of the national anthem. The heartfelt rendition drew loud applause from the packed arena, with the swimmers visibly moved.

These experiences are examples of the closeness and solidarity that stemmed from Singaporeans seeing ourselves as one, instead of separate groups. In his 2019 National Day Rally speech on the importance of developing a common national consciousness, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that it has taken many years but the concept of being Singaporean is now firmly etched in all Singaporeans.

Now, as the world enters troubled times, Singapore faces new and daunting challenges that we can only face if we stand together as a nation.

### Finding a Shared Identity with a New Social Mix

As a global city and international business hub, just like how we were a migrant nation, we continue to attract people of all nationalities and cultures here. This has led to a gradual change in our social mix over the years. In addition to the existing multiracial, multi-religious and multicultural local population, the social fabric now also includes new citizens and foreigners who bring with them different cultures, beliefs and practices. 

A study from the United Nations shows that the percentage of migrants in Singapore tripled over the past three decades, growing from 24 per cent (727,000) of the population in 1990 to 37 per cent (2.15 million) in 2019. The biggest source of migrants come from Malaysia, followed by China, Indonesia, India and Pakistan.

PM Lee noted in his National Day Rally speech in 2019 that just like Singapore’s forefathers, the immigrants of today have to similarly undergo the process of gradually identifying themselves as Singaporeans, and becoming Singapore citizens. This is a process that took many decades. Singapore’s forefathers arrived as sojourners. Those from China intended to return to their homeland one day, but in the end, the majority chose to remain. They saw this as their new home, and worked to make it succeed, and defended their nation fiercely. Gradually, a Chinese Singaporean identity was developed, said PM Lee.

It was the same for Malay and Indian Singaporeans. During the period of anti-colonial struggle, the Indians were inspired by India’s own struggle for independence while the Malays were inspired by the nationalist movements in Indonesia and Malaya. But like the Chinese, they too, along with the Eurasians, progressively sank their roots in Singapore and a Singapore identity was developed.

Today, the rising number of inter-ethnic and transnational marriages has also added to the complexity of Singapore’s social mix. In 2018, 22.4 per cent of total marriages were between grooms and brides of different ethnic groups, a 16.7 per cent increase from 2008. Singaporeans are more distinct and diverse than ever before.

However, the entry of newcomers to Singapore, coupled with stresses of today has led to increased xenophobia as many view them as competition. Technological and trade disruptions have fuelled concerns about workplace competition and security, with some questioning the need for newcomers who they have to fight with for jobs. Greater connectivity and social media has also made it easier for divisive narratives to take root, sometimes behind the anonymity of a computer screen.

But as a small and open economy with an ageing population, increasing numbers of trans-national families and a low replacement rate, Singapore has to keep its doors open to achieve further growth.

Singapore’s approach to new citizens is one of integration, not assimilation, to welcome and not take away, as we have done from our start as a migrant nation. As PM Lee noted, at the official opening of the Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre on 19 May 2019, being Singaporean, he said, has “never been a matter of subtraction, but of addition; not of becoming less, but more; not of limitation and contraction, but of openness and expansion”.

To integrate new citizens, Singapore needs to reaffirm and promote shared values, find and grow common spaces, share collective experiences and strengthen emotional bonds among our people. Opportunities to interact and understand one another better continue to be key, especially between locals and new citizens.

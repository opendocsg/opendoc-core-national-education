## <font color="#9F213D">Racial Riots (1964 and 1969)</font>

On 21 July 1964, some 20,000 Malays gathered at the Padang for a procession to celebrate Prophet Muhammad’s birthday. Singing and waving banners, the celebrants were just passing Kampong Soo Poo when a glass bottle was hurled into the crowd, hitting someone on the head.

Angry exchanges between the marching Malays and the Chinese bystanders ensued, which soon escalated into violence with more bottles being hurled and punches thrown. As word of the riot spread, more joined in, resulting in fights breaking out across the island. The entire police force was activated and the armed forces mobilised. Tear gas was used to break up fights and an islandwide curfew was imposed.

The person who threw the bottle was never identified but the Singapore government eventually traced the incident to Malay UMNO activists led by then UMNO secretary-general Ja’afar Albar. Prior to the riots, Ja’afar Albar had started a campaign accusing the People’s Action Party (PAP) government of depriving the Malays in Singapore of the special rights given to their Malaysian counterparts.

“I believe the riot was planned; it did not start spontaneously. They were very smart to choose a religious procession so that if we had stopped it, we would be called anti-Muslim. The inflammatory communal and racial speeches made by Malaysian UMNO leaders worked up Malay sentiments in Singapore,” said Mr Othman Wok in Men In White, the 2010 book on the history of the PAP. Mr Othman was Minister for Social Affairs when the riots happened.  

It took 17 days for the situation to stabilise, during which Goodwill Committees were set up across all 51 constituencies at the time, consisting of community leaders of all races. They were tasked to restore harmony amongst the races by listening to and addressing the concerns of residents.  Peace Committees were also formed in the areas hardest hit by the riots to counter rumours.  In all, 23 people lost their lives and another 454 were injured.

However, peace was short-lived. Widespread communal riots broke out between the Malays and Chinese a month later, after the mysterious killing of a Malay trishaw rider in Geylang Serai. 

Curfews were again imposed, and the police and military mobilised. On 14 September, 12 days later, calm was established. By then, 13 people had died and another 106 were injured.

The target was not just the Singapore Chinese, but also the Malay PAP leaders to pressure them into endorsing the primacy of Malays. But Mr Othman and his Malay comrades stood firm and kept the dream of a multiracial society alive.

In 1969, riots between Malays and Chinese erupted again, spilling over to Singapore from Kuala Lumpur (KL) where fighting had broken out as a result of unhappiness surrounding the general elections results and rumours pertaining to the Chinese and Malays.

The election was preceded by outbreaks of racial incidents that created a tense atmosphere. A Malay political worker had been killed by a Chinese gang in Penang, while a Chinese youth was shot and killed by police in Kuala Lumpur.  While election day passed without incident, the parade by winning opposition parties DAP and Gerakan were alleged to be highly provocative, with non-Malays taunting the Malays. They were seen as an attack on Malay supremacy, though the overall election results still favoured the Malay. 

On 13 May, just before UMNO’s procession, fist fights broke out in Setapak, in KL between a group of Malays and Chinese bystanders who taunted them, which escalated into bottle and stone throwing. Violence soon spread across the city and across the border into Singapore. 

On 31 May, fuelled by rumours of the clash, Malay mobs and Chinese triads in Singapore began attacking one another. The seven-day clashes left four people dead and some 80 injured. However, the government was quick to contain the riots before they could spread.  The Internal Security Department (ISD) stepped in to quash the conflicts together with the police.

## <font color="#9F213D">HDB Ethnic Integration Policy (1989)</font>

In the 1980s, more than 20 years after HDB flats were introduced, there were signs that segregation among the races had once again started to take root. Malay households made up more than 30 per cent of the estate population in Bedok and Tampines while the Chinese formed more than 90 per cent of the households in Hougang.  This was made worse by a growing resale market for HDB flats, where families tended to buy flats in areas with more residents of their own race.

Then Minister for National Development S. Dhanabalan warned that it would be “unthinkable” for Singapore to regress to the days before independence, when a certain place was seen as belonging to a certain ethnic or dialect group.

“Living in separate enclaves, the different races would find fewer opportunities to intermingle and understand each other. MPs and community leaders will develop narrow views of society interest. The enclaves will become the seedbeds for communal agitation,” he said at a New Year gathering for community leaders on 6 January 1989. 

Uprooting residents to break up the enclaves, like how it was done through a massive resettlement exercise in the 1960s, was not a viable option. People could still move to live close to others of the same race, as the reestablishment of enclaves at certain estates had shown. Hence, in 1989, the Ethnic Integration Policy was introduced.

Mr Dhanabalan, in introducing the policy to Parliament on 16 February 1989, called it a “open and clear policy”. The policy’s enforceable limits will ensure that the ethnic proportions are kept, which will prevent the races from “regrouping” even in the long run. 

The policy stipulated that the proportion of flats in each neighbourhood for Malays, Chinese, Indians and other minority groups would be 22 per cent, 84 per cent and 10 per cent respectively. The allowable proportion of flats in each block was set at 25 per cent for Malays, 87 per cent for Chinese and 13 per cent for Indians and other races.

## <font color="#9F213D">Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circle</font>

![](/assets/ircc.png)

After the arrest of 15 Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) members in Singapore in December 2001, there were jitters in the community. The Malay/Muslim community was worried that they would be discriminated against, while non-Muslims grew suspicious of their Muslim neighbours.

This growing distrust threatened to disrupt Singapore’s multiracial, multi-religious society, prompting then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong to promote open and public dialogues. He believed that the best way to address pockets of disquiet within society was for the community itself to take action.

“To strengthen race and religious relations, every community in Singapore must look within itself, and prevent developments that pull the community away from the larger Singapore society. We must also reach outside our own communities, and build bonds of confidence, friendship and trust with others,” he said, at one such dialogue with young Malay/Muslim professionals on 2 February 2002. 

Apart from encouraging every community to speak up against extremist voices, weed out deviant teachings and remove practices that reduce common space between the races, the government also formed Inter-Racial Confidence Circles, or IRCCs, in 2002.

They served as important bridges for leaders of the various racial and religious communities to interact through networking sessions and inter-faith dialogues and visits. 

Renamed Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles in 2007, IRCCs continue to act as peacekeepers. Besides promoting inter-faith interaction and understanding, they also respond quickly to racial and religious tensions by addressing ground concerns, quashing rumours and preserving solidarity among members.

IRCCs have also had to arbitrate on the use of common spaces by religious organisations like mosques or temples. One example was when a fire-walking festival used the common area outside a Hindu temple. The IRCCs were involved during the planning stages to find ways to minimise disruption to residents and businesses. 

Kembangan-Chai Chee IRCC chairman Fazlur Rahman noted that religious leaders already have sufficient platforms to communicate with each other. “What we need now are more ground-up initiatives where members of the community from various religious groups, especially the youth, come forward.” 

Indeed, 29-year-old librarian Joti Upadhya, who attended the National IRCC Convention 2018, said: “Usually we need to have events to discuss such issues (on race and religion). But we need to go beyond that. We should discuss them with our friends during lunches or gatherings.”

As Mr Goh said: “Each community does not exist in isolation, but as a member of the larger society. Its success and progress depend not only on its own efforts, but also on how well it gets along with the other communities, and how well we all manage to work together as a nation.”

## <font color="#9F213D">Our National Pledge and Anthem</font>

Author of the Singapore pledge, Mr S. Rajaratnam, who was Minister for Foreign Affairs at the time, believed that differences in language, race and religion were potentially divisive and had used the pledge to emphasise that these differences could be overcome if Singaporeans were united in their commitment to the country. 

The fundamentals of Singapore’s multicultural society were never to forget differences, but rather to acknowledge them, set them aside and go beyond them. This distinction is clear during the creation of the pledge. While an earlier version read “forget differences of race, language and religion”, the version recited today reads “regardless of race, language or religion”.

After three drafts and multiple revisions, the Singapore pledge was finalised. On 24 August 1966, about 500,000 students at all 529 government and government-aided schools held the first daily recitation of the pledge of allegiance before the national flag.

*From the National Archives of Singapore: "To inculcate a love for the nation, flag raising and lowering ceremonies were introduced in schools in 1966. The national anthem was sung and the pledge recited. All students participated in the ceremonies. The practice remains today."*

“Majulah Singapura”, or Onward Singapore in English, was composed in 1958 by Singapore composer Zubir Said. The song was originally commissioned by the City Council of Singapore in 1958 as an official song for the council’s function.  But after Singapore attained self-governance in 1959, a shortened and more upbeat version was made the country’s national anthem, as a musical expression of Singapore’s identity as a nation, its melody and lyrics echoing the enduring hope and spirit of Singaporeans for progress. 

According to former Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Toh Chin Chye, Majulah Singapura was chosen for its patriotic lyrics that expressed the aspirations of the people of Singapore. He added that the lyrics of the national anthem were specifically written in Malay as it is an indigenous language of the region and would appeal to all races.

## <font color="#9F213D">Integrating New Citizens</font>

What bonds us as Singaporeans is not how we look, but the way we behave, our values and the norms we uphold. This can be challenging for new citizens who may have to change the way they would normally act and interact with people.

As of June 2019, there were 3.5 million Singapore citizens, an increase of 0.8 per cent from the previous year. There were 22,550 new citizens in 2018, up from 22,076 the year before. The majority (61.6 per cent) were from Southeast Asian countries, with 32.4 per cent from other Asian countries and 6 per cent from countries outside Asia. 

To help new citizens adapt, the National Integration Council (NIC) was set up in April 2009 to promote integration through ground-up projects. Among more than 280 initiatives the council has funded are Singapore heritage visits, organised by the Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Associations, as well as a short film –- #WhyBeTowkayTan – about a kopitiam runner from China who spends Chinese New Year Eve with co-workers.

In 2011, the NIC developed the Singapore Citizenship Journey, consisting of interactive online modules on topics such as Singapore’s history and culture, national symbols and national policies, and experiential learning programmes such as visits to museums. The mandatory programme also includes community sharing sessions where new citizens meet residents and grassroots leaders from their constituencies.

Each year, a National Citizenship Ceremony is held in conjunction with the National Day celebrations, where new citizens receive their pink NRICs and citizen certificates. Citizenship ceremonies are also held every three months or so in group representation constituencies (GRCs) across the island, aimed at fostering a deeper sense of belonging among new citizens.

Often, new citizens have lived in Singapore for years, initially coming to the country in search of better career prospects or to study, but later finding themselves attracted to the way things are done in Singapore.

Software engineers Nguyen The Huy, 33, and Tran Thi Tuyet Mai, 33, who became new citizens after working in Singapore for a decade or so after graduating from the National University of Singapore said they were attracted to the education system here. "We appreciate the diversity in the system and believe it will help our children gain a broader perspective of the world," said Mr Huy. 

But while most Singaporeans accept that immigration is important, many also feel that immigrants can do more to integrate into society. An Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) survey of about 4,000 Singapore citizens and permanent residents, released in 2019, found that about nine in 10 felt that it was good to have people of different nationalities living in the same neighbourhood, and that they can learn a lot from the immigrants’ cultures. However, more than six in 10 said immigrants are not doing enough to integrate into Singapore. 

A major stumbling block, identified during dialogues with the survey participants, is the limiting beliefs and perceptions about each other due to stereotypes, fear of rejection and lack of trust, said Culture, Community and Youth Minister Grace Fu at a National Integration Council convention on 3 August 2019. “To overcome this, many of our participants agreed that daily interactions at the personal level is the best place to start from but we need to first overcome our initial inertia.”

Hence, MCCY is looking to add new ways of partnership and to involve more parts of Singapore’s society, starting with a workgroup with Singaporeans to help shape the curriculum of the Singapore Citizenship Journey.

## <font color="#9F213D">Striving towards a Multi-Abled Singapore</font>

A supermarket with lower checkout counters for wheelchair users and magnifying glasses for the visually impaired to read labels more easily is just one of the facilities at the Enabling Village. Here people with and without disabilities are accepted for who they are.

Located near Redhill MRT station, the $25 million set-up opened in 2015. It has food outlets run by Soul Food and Shatec, which hire people with disabilities, and an art gallery where visitors can buy artworks and merchandise designed by people with autism.

To boost the job prospects of people with disabilities, it also has an information and career centre, as well as training facilities such as a mock hotel room where they can learn housekeeping. A range of training courses is also offered. 

As Singapore strives to be more inclusive, there have been more initiatives that not only cater to people of all needs and abilities but also encourage interaction among them.

Another example is Kindle Garden, an inclusive preschool that is the first of its kind in Singapore. It enables children of all abilities, from mainstream ability children to those with severe needs, to learn and play together. About 30 per cent of the 80 or so children currently enrolled at the preschool, which is run by non-profit AWWA, have special needs such as autism, Down Syndrome or cerebral palsy. 

This mindset has extended to the workplace, such as at Foreword Coffee. The specialty coffee company has a social mission – to empower people with special needs by giving them jobs and equipping them with barista skills.

The work processes at their cafés are split into four stations so that each employee can focus on just one task. The coffee machine for Foreword Coffee’s third outlet, at Temasek Shophouse, also uses a switch that can be flipped easily instead of the more conventional knob. It was bought specially for staff with health conditions such as cerebral palsy, who do not have enough strength in their arms.

In 2019, out of 18 staff members across three outlets – at the Civil Service College, Centre for Healthcare Innovation at Tan Tock Seng Hospital and Temasek Shophouse – 14 have special needs such as autism, cerebral palsy and hearing impairment. The company is looking to set up its fourth outlet, given the long list of job applicants.

“There is a pool of talent waiting to be tapped on. We are proof that they not only have the ability to work, but also work well,” said Foreword Coffee director Nadi Chan.

## <font color="#9F213D">Volunteerism in Singapore</font>

As Singapore approached the second millennium, it faced a new crisis: an ageing population.

The average life expectancy of a Singaporean had increased to 78 in 2000, and in the same year, birth rates had plunged to just 1.6. The number of seniors living here is also set to double to around 900,000 by 2030. 

The burden on the working population will only increase, even as its size shrinks. Getting able-bodied seniors to help their peers in need is one way around the problem. And so elderly volunteerism took root in Singapore.

In countries like the United States, it is common for the elderly in states like New York and Louisiana to help others with tasks such as financial management and handicrafts under a movement called Retired and Senior Volunteer Programme (RSVP).    

In 1998, then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, impressed by the success and influence of the movement, launched the Singapore chapter of RSVP. 

Explaining its significance, he said: “Singapore’s main asset, its human resource, is becoming better trained and more valuable. Hence, we should devise innovative ways to better utilise it. One way is to stretch the productive life expectancy of Singaporeans beyond their formal retirement. This is where RSVP can help, by providing older Singaporeans an avenue to actively contribute their life's experiences.”
Between 2018 and 2019, the non-profit organisation, made up of purely senior volunteers, helped 172,221 beneficiaries.  It has close to 2,500 members today, up from 824 in 2016. 

This supports an upward trend in volunteerism in Singapore, especially among retirees. In a National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre survey published in May 2017, the number of volunteers aged 55 to 64 increased from 18 per cent in 2014 to 20 per cent in 2016. The total number of volunteers almost doubled between 2014 and 2016.

However, Singapore’s national volunteerism rate still stands at just 29 per cent, compared with 35 per cent in 2016 – a drop of six percentage points. On 5 June 2018, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu said during a keynote address during an Asian Venture Philanthropy Network's (AVPN) conference that the government is looking to boost volunteerism rates to 70 per cent by 2023. 

In 2019, SG Cares, a national movement to promote volunteerism, was launched. The Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth partnered community groups to establish Volunteer Centres, which aid in volunteer matching, deployment and training. In addition, an SG Care app was developed to allow volunteers to find volunteering opportunities more easily, such as by allowing them to choose their preferred timings or propose or collaborate on projects to help those in need.


These efforts have continued into 2020. Budget 2020 has set aside $350m in the newly established Community Capability Trust, which social service agencies can tap into. A Bicentennial Community Fund, too, will further assist institutes of public characters (IPC). Together, the government hopes to cultivate a “giving culture”.

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the opening of the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre’s The Giving Place on 7 July 2008 said: “We have to get our people to do their best, do well for themselves, and so help the whole country to progress. Our system makes full use of the talent and entrepreneurial drive of our citizens, and this has delivered growth and improved the lives of all citizens. But for this to be sustainable, our society has to remain cohesive and stable, and that means that those who have succeeded must feel the impulse to give back to society.”

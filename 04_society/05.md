# Digging Deeper: Examples
## Racial Riots (1964 and 1969)

On 21 July 1964, some 20,000 Malays gathered at the Padang for a procession to celebrate Prophet Muhammad’s birthday. Singing and waving banners, the celebrants were just passing Kampong Soo Poo when a glass bottle was hurled into the crowd, hitting someone on the head.

Angry exchanges between the marching Malays and the Chinese bystanders ensued, which soon escalated into violence with more bottles being hurled and punches thrown. As word of the riot spread, more joined in, resulting in fights breaking out across the island. The entire police force was activated and the armed forces mobilised. Tear gas was used to break up fights and an islandwide curfew was imposed.

The person who threw the bottle was never identified but the Singapore government eventually traced the incident to Malay UMNO activists led by then UMNO secretary-general Ja’afar Albar. Prior to the riots, Ja’afar Albar had started a campaign accusing the People’s Action Party (PAP) government of depriving the Malays in Singapore of the special rights given to their Malaysian counterparts.

“I believe the riot was planned; it did not start spontaneously. They were very smart to choose a religious procession so that if we had stopped it, we would be called anti-Muslim. The inflammatory communal and racial speeches made by Malaysian UMNO leaders worked up Malay sentiments in Singapore,” said Mr Othman Wok in Men In White, the 2010 book on the history of the PAP. Mr Othman was Minister for Social Affairs when the riots happened.  

It took 17 days for the situation to stabilise, during which Goodwill Committees were set up across all 51 constituencies at the time, consisting of community leaders of all races. They were tasked to restore harmony amongst the races by listening to and addressing the concerns of residents.  Peace Committees were also formed in the areas hardest hit by the riots to counter rumours.  In all, 23 people lost their lives and another 454 were injured.

However, peace was short-lived. Widespread communal riots broke out between the Malays and Chinese a month later, after the mysterious killing of a Malay trishaw rider in Geylang Serai. 

Curfews were again imposed, and the police and military mobilised. On 14 September, 12 days later, calm was established. By then, 13 people had died and another 106 were injured.

The target was not just the Singapore Chinese, but also the Malay PAP leaders to pressure them into endorsing the primacy of Malays. But Mr Othman and his Malay comrades stood firm and kept the dream of a multiracial society alive.

In 1969, riots between Malays and Chinese erupted again, spilling over to Singapore from Kuala Lumpur (KL) where fighting had broken out as a result of unhappiness surrounding the general elections results and rumours pertaining to the Chinese and Malays.

The election was preceded by outbreaks of racial incidents that created a tense atmosphere. A Malay political worker had been killed by a Chinese gang in Penang, while a Chinese youth was shot and killed by police in Kuala Lumpur.  While election day passed without incident, the parade by winning opposition parties DAP and Gerakan were alleged to be highly provocative, with non-Malays taunting the Malays. They were seen as an attack on Malay supremacy, though the overall election results still favoured the Malay. 

On 13 May, just before UMNO’s procession, fist fights broke out in Setapak, in KL between a group of Malays and Chinese bystanders who taunted them, which escalated into bottle and stone throwing. Violence soon spread across the city and across the border into Singapore. 

On 31 May, fuelled by rumours of the clash, Malay mobs and Chinese triads in Singapore began attacking one another. The seven-day clashes left four people dead and some 80 injured. However, the government was quick to contain the riots before they could spread.  The Internal Security Department (ISD) stepped in to quash the conflicts together with the police.

## HDB Ethnic Integration Policy (1989)

In the 1980s, more than 20 years after HDB flats were introduced, there were signs that segregation among the races had once again started to take root. Malay households made up more than 30 per cent of the estate population in Bedok and Tampines while the Chinese formed more than 90 per cent of the households in Hougang.  This was made worse by a growing resale market for HDB flats, where families tended to buy flats in areas with more residents of their own race.

Then Minister for National Development S. Dhanabalan warned that it would be “unthinkable” for Singapore to regress to the days before independence, when a certain place was seen as belonging to a certain ethnic or dialect group.

“Living in separate enclaves, the different races would find fewer opportunities to intermingle and understand each other. MPs and community leaders will develop narrow views of society interest. The enclaves will become the seedbeds for communal agitation,” he said at a New Year gathering for community leaders on 6 January 1989. 

Uprooting residents to break up the enclaves, like how it was done through a massive resettlement exercise in the 1960s, was not a viable option. People could still move to live close to others of the same race, as the reestablishment of enclaves at certain estates had shown. Hence, in 1989, the Ethnic Integration Policy was introduced.

<br>*Image: How new enclaves formed by people purchasing flats near their own race, despite moving away from kampongs in the old enclaves.*

Mr Dhanabalan, in introducing the policy to Parliament on 16 February 1989, called it a “open and clear policy”. The policy’s enforceable limits will ensure that the ethnic proportions are kept, which will prevent the races from “regrouping” even in the long run. 

The policy stipulated that the proportion of flats in each neighbourhood for Malays, Chinese, Indians and other minority groups would be 22 per cent, 84 per cent and 10 per cent respectively. The allowable proportion of flats in each block was set at 25 per cent for Malays, 87 per cent for Chinese and 13 per cent for Indians and other races.

## Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circle

![](/assets/ircc.png)

After the arrest of 15 Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) members in Singapore in December 2001, there were jitters in the community. The Malay/Muslim community was worried that they would be discriminated against, while non-Muslims grew suspicious of their Muslim neighbours.

This growing distrust threatened to disrupt Singapore’s multiracial, multi-religious society, prompting then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong to promote open and public dialogues. He believed that the best way to address pockets of disquiet within society was for the community itself to take action.

“To strengthen race and religious relations, every community in Singapore must look within itself, and prevent developments that pull the community away from the larger Singapore society. We must also reach outside our own communities, and build bonds of confidence, friendship and trust with others,” he said, at one such dialogue with young Malay/Muslim professionals on 2 February 2002. 

Apart from encouraging every community to speak up against extremist voices, weed out deviant teachings and remove practices that reduce common space between the races, the government also formed Inter-Racial Confidence Circles, or IRCCs, in 2002.

They served as important bridges for leaders of the various racial and religious communities to interact through networking sessions and inter-faith dialogues and visits. 

Renamed Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles in 2007, IRCCs continue to act as peacekeepers. Besides promoting inter-faith interaction and understanding, they also respond quickly to racial and religious tensions by addressing ground concerns, quashing rumours and preserving solidarity among members.

IRCCs have also had to arbitrate on the use of common spaces by religious organisations like mosques or temples. One example was when a fire-walking festival used the common area outside a Hindu temple. The IRCCs were involved during the planning stages to find ways to minimise disruption to residents and businesses. 

Kembangan-Chai Chee IRCC chairman Fazlur Rahman noted that religious leaders already have sufficient platforms to communicate with each other. “What we need now are more ground-up initiatives where members of the community from various religious groups, especially the youth, come forward.” 

Indeed, 29-year-old librarian Joti Upadhya, who attended the National IRCC Convention 2018, said: “Usually we need to have events to discuss such issues (on race and religion). But we need to go beyond that. We should discuss them with our friends during lunches or gatherings.”

As Mr Goh said: “Each community does not exist in isolation, but as a member of the larger society. Its success and progress depend not only on its own efforts, but also on how well it gets along with the other communities, and how well we all manage to work together as a nation.” 

## Recent Racial Incidents

### Make Curry, Not War
In 2011, curry became the hot topic among Singaporeans. The incident, known as the “curry incident”, was sparked off when a Chinese family complained about the strong smell of curry coming from their Indian neighbour’s home. With the help of the Community Mediation Centre (CMC), both families voluntarily eventually agreed to compromise: the Indian family would cook curry only when their Chinese neighbours were out of the house, and the Chinese neighbours would try their curry. The incident led to positive ground-up campaigns and reactions in support of the Indian family, such as the “Cook and Share a Pot of Curry” campaign.  In contrast, negative actions such as uploading a video stereotyping mainland Chinese immigrants and mocking them simply leads to more unhappiness and does not solve the issue.  

In 2012, Singaporean Amy Cheong made the headlines after she launched a racist tirade against Malays and their wedding practices. She disparaged Malays for holding weddings at void decks and mocked their divorce rate. She was promptly fired from work and left Singapore after being shamed and threatened by netizens.  A police report was made against her, but she was let off with a stern warning after issuing a public apology. 

As Singapore welcomes a greater diversity of cultures, these two incidents shows us how communication and consideration for other cultures can go a long way in building a harmonious society. 

### Fake News, Real Emotions

In 2016, a couple running the socio-political website, The Real Singapore, was charged for publishing incendiary fake news. One particular article about a Filipino's fictitious complaints over Thaipusam fanned resentment against the Pinoy community here.  Ai Takagi and Yang Kaiheng, who were jailed for 10 months and eight months respectively, published the articles as early as 2013. Their site has since been shut down. 

Thoughtless actions can also trigger incidents. In February 2018, rumours began to spread online that food stall Green Delights was violating its Halal status after an ambiguous photo was shared online.  The viral photo showed a Halal sticker being placed alongside a poster advertising pork belly rice on a pillar when, in fact, the poster belonged to an adjacent stall. Business dropped by as much as 20 per cent as a result.

### Navigating a multi-religious society
In February 2016, controversy arose over Madonna’s first performance in Singapore, sparked by the Catholic Church’s advice for congregants to skip the show.  The Media Development Authority (MDA) had previously rated the show R18, and banned the performance of certain song items that were judged as religiously sensitive.  Some members of the public took issue with how the church, a religious body, had tried to persuade the authorities to disallow the concert.  They believed that religious organisations should not interfere with non-religious events. This sentiment re-emerged in 2019, with the banning of a concert by Swedish metal band Watain. 

As a multi-religious society, Singaporeans need to be considerate to those who hold different religious views in our community. We must not allow any words or actions that are targeted at any religion and intended to cause offense to go unchallenged. However, we must also remain mindful not to impose our religious values on the common space for everyone, because Singapore remains a secular nation. As the authorities continue to try to balance these two priorities in a changing world, let us do our part by being more understanding of different religious beliefs. 

### Being Aware of Sensitivities; Thinking of Others' Lived Experiences

In August 2016, teen blogger Amos Yee stood trial again for six charges of deliberate intent to wound religious feelings, and two charges of failure to turn up for police interviews.  He had previously been charged for a Youtube and blog post with the deliberate intent to wound religious feelings and for distributing obscene material.  Yee was sentenced to another 6 weeks’ jail from 13 October, before fleeing the country on 16 December to the United States to seek political asylum. Yee’s case provoked much discussion in Singapore, over both the severity of his charges despite his young age, as well as the limitations of free speech in Singapore with respect to religion. Although many members of the Christian community signed a petition claiming not to be offended by Yee’s original post in which he criticised Christians and called Jesus “power hungry and malicious” and “full of bull”,  Yee was still found guilty of the deliberate intent to wound religious feelings. 

In 2018, an Indian national and Singapore permanent resident caused a stir on the internet after posting an image on Facebook of a Singapore flag being ripped to reveal an Indian flag. Many Singaporeans found the post disrespectful and insulting of Singapore, and wrote in to his employer’s Facebook page to call for his removal from his job. As a result, Mr. Avijit Das Patnaik was fired from his job and given a stern warning by the police.  

Although the responses were mainly against his treatment of the flag, some also made anti-immigrant remarks centered on his Indian race, expressing their unhappiness about having to compete for jobs with non-locals. However, Singapore is a city of immigrants – more than 80% of our current population were immigrants. Mr Aviiit Das Patnaik explained that his intention was to show that though his heart was still with India, his body was wholly Singaporean as he had settled in his new home in Singapore.

As a global city, attempts should be made to be more understanding to immigrants of all races who have left their homelands for Singapore, and help them to settle down, appreciate, and come to love their new home. Singaporeans should be more understanding of their feelings towards Singapore, instead of jumping to conclusions. Of course, each side must also understand that misunderstandings may occur, and carefully consider how actions may be interpreted before doing them.

Likewise, the “Brownface” incident in 2019 showed that paying close attention to racial sensitivities remains critical. In an advertisement, Chinese actor Dennis Chew dressed up as characters of different races, including as a Malay woman and an Indian man in office wear. His skin was also darkened as part of the get-up. Some Singaporeans took offence to it, calling the move racist. Others believed there was no malice behind the advertisement.  A pair of local internet personalities Preeti Nair and her brother Subhas then escalated the issue by making an expletive-ridden video that mocked the original advertisement. The Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) investigated the advertisement and found that while it had not breached any law, it was done in poor taste.  The involved parties, including the actor and creative agency, all issued apologies.  Ms Nair and her brother were also warned by the Ministry of Home Affairs after they apologised for their act. 

Discussion surrounding “brownface” were revived in 2020, when a photo of Raffles Institution students doing “blackface” resurfaced on social media. Such stereotypes of different races are harmful and hurtful for minorities, because it is viewed as reducing their race and culture to just their appearance and accents. We should continue to do our best to be sensitive and considerate to people from different races within our society, keeping in mind that what one finds acceptable may be offensive to others as a result of different cultures and lived experiences.

### Educating, Not Condemning

But there have also been incidents involving race that can be resolved amiably. One such case involved local online influencer Sheena Phua, who came under fire in 2019 after she made an Instagram post that called two men wearing turbans “huge obstructions” to her view at the Singapore Grand Prix. Her comment was seen as mocking the Sikhs.  

However, the Sikh community's reaction was gracious. They invited her on an informal tour around Central Sikh Temple, where she got to learn about the culture. Besides issuing apologies, she also released photos of the tour and thanked the Sikh community for its kindness. 

Each of these examples shows that keeping Singapore a multiracial and multicultural society remains a work in progress. Much has been achieved but more can be done to encourage mutual understanding among the population.

## Our National Pledge and Anthem 

Author of the Singapore pledge, Mr S. Rajaratnam, who was Minister for Foreign Affairs at the time, believed that differences in language, race and religion were potentially divisive and had used the pledge to emphasise that these differences could be overcome if Singaporeans were united in their commitment to the country. 

The fundamentals of Singapore’s multicultural society were never to forget differences, but rather to acknowledge them, set them aside and go beyond them. This distinction is clear during the creation of the pledge. While an earlier version read “forget differences of race, language and religion”, the version recited today reads “regardless of race, language or religion”.

After three drafts and multiple revisions, the Singapore pledge was finalised. On 24 August 1966, about 500,000 students at all 529 government and government-aided schools held the first daily recitation of the pledge of allegiance before the national flag. 

“Majulah Singapura”, or Onward Singapore in English, was composed in 1958 by Singapore composer Zubir Said. The song was originally commissioned by the City Council of Singapore in 1958 as an official song for the council’s function.  But after Singapore attained self-governance in 1959, a shortened and more upbeat version was made the country’s national anthem, as a musical expression of Singapore’s identity as a nation, its melody and lyrics echoing the enduring hope and spirit of Singaporeans for progress. 

According to former Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Toh Chin Chye, Majulah Singapura was chosen for its patriotic lyrics that expressed the aspirations of the people of Singapore. He added that the lyrics of the national anthem were specifically written in Malay as it is an indigenous language of the region and would appeal to all races.   

## UNESCO Bids and Our Heritage

As a young and small country with little to no natural heritage, Singapore still manages to punch above its weight, boasting one UNESCO World Heritage Site, and a bid to include an item in the Representative List (RL) of the Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) of Humanity. As Singaporeans, there is much to be proud of!

### The Singapore Botanic Gardens journey to become a UNESCO World Heritage Site
In 2015, after a 5-year application journey, the 161-year-old Singapore Botanic Gardens was awarded the status of UNESCO World Heritage Site (WHS), making it Singapore’s first UNESCO WHS.  Singapore’s Botanic Gardens is the first Botanic Gardens on the list from Asia, and the third Botanic Gardens on the entire list, joining the Orto botanico di Padova in Padua, Italy and the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, England. 

In fact, as a former British colony, Singapore’s Botanic Gardens was once an outpost of the British Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. During the British empire, Botanic Gardens performed the dual function of advancing scientific knowledge and economic development. The Singapore Botanic Gardens played a large role in the development of the rubber trade in South-East Asia in the late 1800s, and in the breeding and hybridization of Orchirds in the mid 1900s, a field in which the Botanic Gardens remains unparalleled today. These achievements, along with the exceptional preservation of the gardens through the efforts of the many generations of Singaporeans involved, led to its achievement of the UNESCO WHS status. Our Singapore Botanic Gardens is truly something we can be proud of!

### Singapore’s Hawker Culture nomination for UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage list.
After the recognition of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, Singapore did not rest on its laurels. In March 2019, Singapore submitted its nomination for its hawker culture to be inscribed on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity (ICH).  This nomination serves as a recognition of hawker centres as communal dining spaces, of the hard work generations of hawkers have put in, and of the greater appreciation Singaporeans have begun to have for our hawkers and our hawker culture.  Although hawker culture may not have originated in Singapore, and is not exclusive to the island, it has grown to become something Singaporeans value as part of our culture, history and identity. 

Although many warned of the impending doom of Singapore’s hawker culture, support schemes and programmes from the government seems to have turned the trend around. Proof of the vibrancy and continuity of our hawker culture can be seen in the number of aspiring young hawkers we have, with examples like “Beng Who Cooks” rising to fame recently on the back of their charity work during circuit breaker.  Programmes like the Staggered Rent Scheme and the Incubation Stall Programme, which reduce the initial rent paid by new hawkers, have encouraged more young people today to venture into the hawker industry. A mentorship programme with experienced hawkers has also been set-up, to help young hawkers get their footing more quickly.  Although some of these newcomers have since thrown in the towel, many more continue to keep going and to thrive, particularly in the new not-for-profit social entreprise hawker centres like Timbre+ and the new Pasir Ris Central Hawker Centre. A “Next gen hawker food tour” has even been set-up, to explore the hawker stalls and eateries set-up by young hawkers, showing a desire by the public to support our young hawkers.

### Protecting and preserving our cultural heritage
Although 9 in 10 respondents agree or strongly agree that hawker centres are an important part of Singapore’s identity, according to a 2016 survey by the NEA, we cannot take the continued survival of our hawker culture for granted. Only with the continued support of the government, of business-owners and all of us Singaporeans will we be able to keep this unique cultural heritage alive. Similarly, our Botanic Gardens need to continue to be maintained and developed in the years to come, to remain relevant and valuable to Singaporeans.

The richness of Singapore’s heritage doesn’t end with these two nominations. As part of the 2019 submission, the National Heritage Board is also collating an ICH inventory, comprising other traditions, rituals, crafts, expressions, knowledge and skills that we practise and pass on from generation to generation.  As of July 2020, this inventory already consists of a whopping 119 items, with the number set to continue increasing! As we look around and marvel at the many things that make Singapore our home, we must not forget that these things only exist today as a result of the preservation and effort put in by our forefathers. Let us work together as one Singapore, to preserve our unique cultural heritage for future generations, to make Singapore a home we can all be proud of.


## Singlish and our National Identity

While many today consider Singlish part of our national identity, this has not always been the case! Let us take a moment to explore Singapore’s complex relationship with English/Singlish over the years.

### The history of English in Singapore
English was first introduced to Southeast Asia when the British colonial settlers arrived in the late 1700s, arriving on Singapore’s shores in 1819. However, Malay remained the lingua franca even up until the beginning of the 1900s. In the early 1900s, with the establishment of institutes of higher learning that taught in English, proficiency in English became key to social mobility in terms of further education and employment opportunities. As a result, English took on greater and greater importance, such that at the end of British colonial rule, English had become a language of prestige and was often used as a lingua franca between different ethnic groups.  This more widespread use of English led to the birth of a colloquial variant used in informal domains, influenced by the different languages and dialects spoken – also known as Singlish!

In 1960, a year after the People’s Action Party (PAP) came into power, it implemented a bilingualism policy that essentially made learning English mandatory in primary schools, followed by secondary schools in 1966.  Additionally, in post-independence Singapore, English was established as the official lingua franca, due its ethnic neutrality, as well as its economic benefits, in terms of international trade and access to English-language educational resources.  

The war against Singlish – the Speak Good English Movement
However, this shift entailed some sacrifices. Over the next few decades, Singaporeans struggled both with bilingualism, and with speaking good English.  The problem came to a head when a report emerged in the Straits Times in 1999 about declining English standards in Singapore, which some attributed to the pervasive use of Singlish.  This provided the impetus for the launch of the Speak Good English Movement (SGEM) in April 2000, which emphasized the speaking of grammatically-correct, internationally-understood English. The war against Singlish had begun.

However, from the onset, the SGEM has not been without its challenges. Those who argued against Singlish usually emphasized the pragmatic benefits speaking standard English brought, in terms of social mobility and personal gain. However, this overlooks the fact that the prevalence of Singlish in Singapore society also carries with it its inherent value, as a means of communicating authenticity and building solidarity, although this finding seems to depend on gender and education levels.   

Furthermore, with more Singaporeans going abroad and more foreigners living in Singapore, Singlish has become a type of transferrable skill, or a cultural commodity, that non-Singaporeans pick up and value.  In fact, a 2015 article in the BBC showcased numerous examples of non-Singaporeans speaking and showing appreciation of Singlish.  Recently, even films produced in Singlish have managed to win international acclaim at film festivals around the world, contradicting earlier claims by the government that Singlish lacks economic value, and is a hindrance to communication on an international stage. 

Another common argument is that Singlish hinders one’s ability to learn and speak standard English, which is a crucial skill in this globalised world. However, some academics have questioned this assumption, arguing that Singlish is a natural manifestation in response to globalisation, that complements the presence and use of English in Singapore.  Therefore, eradicating Singlish will not necessarily bring about an improvement in the level of standard English in Singapore, just as the elimination of a local culture might not necessarily lead to the embrace of a global one. Instead, Singaporeans should be exposed to and taught to value both Singlish and standard English, learning to use them in different contexts and to code-switch smoothly between them. 

### Validation of Singlish – Speak Good Singlish Movement and Dictionary endorsements
In response to the SGEM, a Speak Good Singlish Movement (SGSM) was launched anonymously in September 2010, to celebrate the use of Singlish, and to distinguish “proper” Singlish from plain broken English.  This display of linguistic chutzpah, or confidence, shows the development of Singlish and its rejection of any anxiety about the use of Singlish, especially as a result of the SGEM.  In 2016, Singlish speakers received even more reason for their confidence, when the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) added 19 new “Singapore English” items to its lexicon,  making it a grand total of 27 Singlish words in the prestigious dictionary.  

This development cemented the central position Singlish occupied for the younger generation, with about half of the respondents of a recent survey claiming that Singlish is a part of Singapore’s national identity and culture.  

### Making Singlish a language for everyone
Despite these glowing endorsements, Singlish is far from established as part of our national identity. In a 2018 study by the Institute of Policy Studies, only eight per cent of respondents chose Singlish as the language they identified with the most, compared to one-third identifying with English, and 28 per cent with their official Mother Tongue languages.  Some Singaporeans have also begun to weaponise Singlish as a test of Singaporean-ness, resulting in Singlish becoming a discriminating force, rather than source of solidarity.  Those who were unable to speak Singlish ‘properly’ are labelled ‘fake’ Singaporeans, in a manner reminiscent of how English-educated Chinese were (are) mocked for being ‘bananas’. 

Although Singlish still lacks acknowledgement as part of Singapore’s Intangible Cultural Heritage, its pervasiveness and status amongst Singaporeans cannot be ignored. Although many Singaporeans today fail to identify with Singlish the most, Singlish remains part of the sounds of Singapore, that lets Singaporeans arriving in Singapore know that they are home. As the world starts to take notice of our home-grown dialect, maybe it’s time for Singaporeans too to start thinking about protecting and preserving Singlish as something valuable to our culture and identity.


## Integrating New Citizens

What bonds us as Singaporeans is not how we look, but the way we behave, our values and the norms we uphold. This can be challenging for new citizens who may have to change the way they would normally act and interact with people.

As of June 2019, there were 3.5 million Singapore citizens, an increase of 0.8 per cent from the previous year. There were 22,550 new citizens in 2018, up from 22,076 the year before. The majority (61.6 per cent) were from Southeast Asian countries, with 32.4 per cent from other Asian countries and 6 per cent from countries outside Asia. 

To help new citizens adapt, the National Integration Council (NIC) was set up in April 2009 to promote integration through ground-up projects. Among more than 280 initiatives the council has funded are Singapore heritage visits, organised by the Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Associations, as well as a short film –- #WhyBeTowkayTan – about a kopitiam runner from China who spends Chinese New Year Eve with co-workers.

In 2011, the NIC developed the Singapore Citizenship Journey, consisting of interactive online modules on topics such as Singapore’s history and culture, national symbols and national policies, and experiential learning programmes such as visits to museums. The mandatory programme also includes community sharing sessions where new citizens meet residents and grassroots leaders from their constituencies.

Each year, a National Citizenship Ceremony is held in conjunction with the National Day celebrations, where new citizens receive their pink NRICs and citizen certificates. Citizenship ceremonies are also held every three months or so in group representation constituencies (GRCs) across the island, aimed at fostering a deeper sense of belonging among new citizens.

Often, new citizens have lived in Singapore for years, initially coming to the country in search of better career prospects or to study, but later finding themselves attracted to the way things are done in Singapore.

Software engineers Nguyen The Huy, 33, and Tran Thi Tuyet Mai, 33, who became new citizens after working in Singapore for a decade or so after graduating from the National University of Singapore said they were attracted to the education system here. "We appreciate the diversity in the system and believe it will help our children gain a broader perspective of the world," said Mr Huy. 

But while most Singaporeans accept that immigration is important, many also feel that immigrants can do more to integrate into society. An Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) survey of about 4,000 Singapore citizens and permanent residents, released in 2019, found that about nine in 10 felt that it was good to have people of different nationalities living in the same neighbourhood, and that they can learn a lot from the immigrants’ cultures. However, more than six in 10 said immigrants are not doing enough to integrate into Singapore. 

A major stumbling block, identified during dialogues with the survey participants, is the limiting beliefs and perceptions about each other due to stereotypes, fear of rejection and lack of trust, said Culture, Community and Youth Minister Grace Fu at a National Integration Council convention on 3 August 2019. “To overcome this, many of our participants agreed that daily interactions at the personal level is the best place to start from but we need to first overcome our initial inertia.”

Hence, MCCY is looking to add new ways of partnership and to involve more parts of Singapore’s society, starting with a workgroup with Singaporeans to help shape the curriculum of the Singapore Citizenship Journey.

## Striving towards a Multi-Abled Singapore

A supermarket with lower checkout counters for wheelchair users and magnifying glasses for the visually impaired to read labels more easily is just one of the facilities at the Enabling Village. Here people with and without disabilities are accepted for who they are.

Located near Redhill MRT station, the $25 million set-up opened in 2015. It has food outlets run by Soul Food and Shatec, which hire people with disabilities, and an art gallery where visitors can buy artworks and merchandise designed by people with autism.

To boost the job prospects of people with disabilities, it also has an information and career centre, as well as training facilities such as a mock hotel room where they can learn housekeeping. A range of training courses is also offered. 

As Singapore strives to be more inclusive, there have been more initiatives that not only cater to people of all needs and abilities but also encourage interaction among them.

Another example is Kindle Garden, an inclusive preschool that is the first of its kind in Singapore. It enables children of all abilities, from mainstream ability children to those with severe needs, to learn and play together. About 30 per cent of the 80 or so children currently enrolled at the preschool, which is run by non-profit AWWA, have special needs such as autism, Down Syndrome or cerebral palsy. 

This mindset has extended to the workplace, such as at Foreword Coffee. The specialty coffee company has a social mission – to empower people with special needs by giving them jobs and equipping them with barista skills.

The work processes at their cafés are split into four stations so that each employee can focus on just one task. The coffee machine for Foreword Coffee’s third outlet, at Temasek Shophouse, also uses a switch that can be flipped easily instead of the more conventional knob. It was bought specially for staff with health conditions such as cerebral palsy, who do not have enough strength in their arms.

In 2019, out of 18 staff members across three outlets – at the Civil Service College, Centre for Healthcare Innovation at Tan Tock Seng Hospital and Temasek Shophouse – 14 have special needs such as autism, cerebral palsy and hearing impairment. The company is looking to set up its fourth outlet, given the long list of job applicants.

“There is a pool of talent waiting to be tapped on. We are proof that they not only have the ability to work, but also work well,” said Foreword Coffee director Nadi Chan. 

## COVID-19

In any time of crisis, we can either choose to band together, or draw apart. The COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences, termed “the crisis of a generation” by our Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, is no exception. Let us examine some of these incidents to see what we can learn from them, to help us overcome future crises together. 

### Blaming others in times of uncertainty

Due to the disruptions to our lives from the pandemic, it is natural to develop feelings of resentment. The easiest targets to blame are usually those different from us, who we don’t understand as well. During circuit breaker, we saw cases of Singaporeans allowing their emotions to get the better of them and lashing out at others, or even trying to stir up unhappiness between different races.  In March and April this year, an internet user hiding behind the pseudonym ‘Sharon Liew’ posted offensive content on social media about Indian migrant workers. The owner of the account was later discovered to be a 34-year-old Malay man, who has since been handed four charges related to committing acts promoting unhappiness between different race groups.  Although the internet allows us to pretend to be whoever we want, this should never be used to promote disharmony amongst Singaporeans, or to target those different from us.  

During this time, some have also bought into racist stereotypes, that blamed the spread of the virus on other groups of people. In April, a forum letter was published in the Chinese daily newspaper that linked the COVID-19 outbreak in foreign worker dormitories to the personal hygiene and living habits of migrant workers.  This letter was roundly condemned both by other forum writers, by netizens, and by the Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam. These incidents sparked thoughtful and challenging conversations amongst Singaporeans about issues of racism and the segregation of society, and helped many to examine the racial biases built into social structures, and into their own formation. As our society continues to have such constructive conversations about issues of race, we hope to build better understanding across communities.

Fortunately, this circuit breaker period has also shown us encouraging examples of Singaporeans stepping up to support and help one another.

### Sharing what we have freely with those less fortunate 
From February to June, we saw big and small businesses in Singapore stepping up to give away free masks, food and hand sanitizers to those in need. Big businesses like Razer, Temasek Holdings and Pizza hut stepped up to provide masks and food for Singaporeans in need, with technology firm Razer even going as far as setting up a fully automated mask production line in Singapore to supply masks.  Small business owners also did their bit to help, such as the hawker store ‘Beng Who Cooks’, which started delivering free cooked meals to the underprivileged.  

Individual Singaporeans too stepped up to help, with individuals giving away free masks, hand sanitizers, and organising goody-bag deliveries. In February, Mr. and Mrs. Lim used their own money to buy 6,600 masks to distribute for free to other Singaporeans,  while Ms. Tong and her husband made their own hand sanitiser and placed it in the lift of their HDB block in Serangoon.  Many other Singaporeans have since followed their lead, with hand sanitiser bottles appearing in many a HDB lift. 

### Bringing Singaporeans together to help one another
Although we may not have much, we can also bring people together to help. For example, Mr. Jason Cai, started an initiative called Park $2 Project (P2P) to help those ‘really in need of supplies’, by raising funds to purchase and deliver goody-bags to needy families.  Although he himself might not have had enough money, he managed to raise $10,000 in a single day to buy and deliver goody-bags containing daily necessities to 205 families. Another example is Project Co-Knit with Love, where Ms. Neo Su Yin came up with a mask-strap extender to reduce the trouble her Muslim colleagues faced in removing their surgical masks worn under their tudung to eat and drink.  These mask straps extenders allowed masks to be worn over the tudung, and for the straps to not rest on the ears for extended periods, which was a problem many essential workers faced. By bringing together many knitting Singaporeans, the project was able to provide almost 5,000 mask strap extenders to over 15 essential services organisations, something Ms. Neo would not have been able to do alone. 

### Using our skills to serve one another
Finally, we may have skills that we can use to help others, particularly during times of crisis. For example, LearnDialect.sg, a website run by Mr. and Mrs. Lee, put up free precautionary videos in various dialects for Chinese dialect-speaking elderly, to keep them updated on the coronavirus situation.  A Bengali-speaking NUS graduate, Ms. Chowdhury, also created a translation portal to help doctors and nurses communicate with migrant workers, an innovation that could literally save lives.  This prompted other Singaporeans to come together to create more COVID-19 medical translations, to help medical workers around the world. Sites like Meditranslate.org, founded by Singaporeans, now provide translations for up to 36 different languages, including many Chinese and Indian dialects, as well as many Southeast Asian languages. 

### Emerging stronger from this crisis as one Singapore
As we have seen above, in response to the crisis, most Singaporeans have chosen to band together, instead of drawing apart. The negative incidents above have prompted discussions and meaningful engagements between different segments of society, whether divided by race, age, or socio-economic status. The number of young Singaporeans coming forward to discuss and think about issues relating to race and privilege has been encouraging. These conversations have helped Singaporeans learn more about one another, which helps to guard against racism and false-stereotyping. To become a more empathetic and compassionate society, Singaporeans need to continue having open and challenging conversations with one another, to develop greater inter-cultural understanding.

In addition, Singaporeans have shown a willingness to give to and care for the least fortunate in society. Singaporeans across the board have given much more to charity this year than ever before, matching the 2019 donations total within the first 5 months of 2020. The examples of Singaporeans stepping up to serve and support one another, in big ways and small, show us that the ‘Kampung’ spirit of looking out for one another is well and alive in Singapore. With the fallout of the pandemic expected to last for many more months, we look forward to Singaporeans continuing to find ways to support one another as we seek to emerge stronger together.


## Volunteerism in Singapore

As Singapore approached the second millennium, it faced a new crisis: an ageing population.

The average life expectancy of a Singaporean had increased to 78 in 2000, and in the same year, birth rates had plunged to just 1.6.     The number of seniors living here is also set to double to around 900,000 by 2030. 

The burden on the working population will only increase, even as its size shrinks. Getting able-bodied seniors to help their peers in need is one way around the problem. And so elderly volunteerism took root in Singapore.

In countries like the United States, it is common for the elderly in states like New York and Louisiana to help others with tasks such as financial management and handicrafts under a movement called Retired and Senior Volunteer Programme (RSVP).    

In 1998, then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, impressed by the success and influence of the movement, launched the Singapore chapter of RSVP. 

Explaining its significance, he said: “Singapore’s main asset, its human resource, is becoming better trained and more valuable. Hence, we should devise innovative ways to better utilise it. One way is to stretch the productive life expectancy of Singaporeans beyond their formal retirement. This is where RSVP can help, by providing older Singaporeans an avenue to actively contribute their life's experiences.”
Between 2018 and 2019, the non-profit organisation, made up of purely senior volunteers, helped 172,221 beneficiaries.  It has close to 2,500 members today, up from 824 in 2016. 

This supports an upward trend in volunteerism in Singapore, especially among retirees. In a National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre survey published in May 2017, the number of volunteers aged 55 to 64 increased from 18 per cent in 2014 to 20 per cent in 2016. The total number of volunteers almost doubled between 2014 and 2016.

However, Singapore’s national volunteerism rate still stands at just 29 per cent, compared with 35 per cent in 2016 – a drop of six percentage points. On 5 June 2018, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu said during a keynote address during an Asian Venture Philanthropy Network's (AVPN) conference that the government is looking to boost volunteerism rates to 70 per cent by 2023. 

In 2019, SG Cares, a national movement to promote volunteerism, was launched. The Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth partnered community groups to establish Volunteer Centres, which aid in volunteer matching, deployment and training. In addition, an SG Care app was developed to allow volunteers to find volunteering opportunities more easily, such as by allowing them to choose their preferred timings or propose or collaborate on projects to help those in need.

These efforts have continued into 2020. Budget 2020 has set aside $350m in the newly established Community Capability Trust, which social service agencies can tap into. A Bicentennial Community Fund, too, will further assist institutes of public characters (IPC). Together, the government hopes to cultivate a “giving culture”.

Said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the opening of the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre’s The Giving Place on 7 July 2008: “We have to get our people to do their best, do well for themselves, and so help the whole country to progress. Our system makes full use of the talent and entrepreneurial drive of our citizens, and this has delivered growth and improved the lives of all citizens. But for this to be sustainable, our society has to remain cohesive and stable, and that means that those who have succeeded must feel the impulse to give back to society.”

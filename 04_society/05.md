## Case Study: Racial Riots (1964 and 1969)

On 21 July 1964, some 20,000 Malays gathered at the Padang for a procession to celebrate Prophet Muhammad’s birthday. Singing and waving banners, the celebrants were just passing Kampong Soo Poo when a glass bottle was hurled into the crowd, hitting someone on the head.

Angry exchanges between the marching Malays and the Chinese bystanders ensued, which soon escalated into violence with more bottles being hurled and punches thrown. As word of the riot spread, more joined in, resulting in fights breaking out across the island. The entire police force was activated and the armed forces mobilised. Tear gas was used to break up fights and an islandwide curfew was imposed.

The person who threw the bottle was never identified but the Singapore government eventually traced the incident to Malay UMNO activists led by then UMNO secretary-general Ja’afar Albar. Prior to the riots, Ja’afar Albar had started a campaign accusing the People’s Action Party (PAP) government of depriving the Malays in Singapore of the special rights given to their Malaysian counterparts.

“I believe the riot was planned; it did not start spontaneously. They were very smart to choose a religious procession so that if we had stopped it, we would be called anti-Muslim. The inflammatory communal and racial speeches made by Malaysian UMNO leaders worked up Malay sentiments in Singapore,” said Mr Othman Wok in Men In White, the 2010 book on the history of the PAP. Mr Othman was Minister for Social Affairs when the riots happened.  

It took 17 days for the situation to stabilise, during which Goodwill Committees were set up across all 51 constituencies at the time, consisting of community leaders of all races. They were tasked to restore harmony amongst the races by listening to and addressing the concerns of residents.  Peace Committees were also formed in the areas hardest hit by the riots to counter rumours.  In all, 23 people lost their lives and another 454 were injured.

However, peace was short-lived. Widespread communal riots broke out between the Malays and Chinese a month later, after the mysterious killing of a Malay trishaw rider in Geylang Serai. 

Curfews were again imposed, and the police and military mobilised. On 14 September, 12 days later, calm was established. By then, 13 people had died and another 106 were injured.

The target was not just the Singapore Chinese, but also the Malay PAP leaders to pressure them into endorsing the primacy of Malays. But Mr Othman and his Malay comrades stood firm and kept the dream of a multiracial society alive.

In 1969, riots between Malays and Chinese erupted again, spilling over to Singapore from Kuala Lumpur (KL) where fighting had broken out as a result of unhappiness surrounding the general elections results and rumours pertaining to the Chinese and Malays.

The election was preceded by outbreaks of racial incidents that created a tense atmosphere. A Malay political worker had been killed by a Chinese gang in Penang, while a Chinese youth was shot and killed by police in Kuala Lumpur.  While election day passed without incident, the parade by winning opposition parties DAP and Gerakan were alleged to be highly provocative, with non-Malays taunting the Malays. They were seen as an attack on Malay supremacy, though the overall election results still favoured the Malay. 

On 13 May, just before UMNO’s procession, fist fights broke out in Setapak, in KL between a group of Malays and Chinese bystanders who taunted them, which escalated into bottle and stone throwing. Violence soon spread across the city and across the border into Singapore. 

On 31 May, fuelled by rumours of the clash, Malay mobs and Chinese triads in Singapore began attacking one another. The seven-day clashes left four people dead and some 80 injured. However, the government was quick to contain the riots before they could spread.  The Internal Security Department (ISD) stepped in to quash the conflicts together with the police.

## Case Study: HDB Ethnic Integration Policy (1989)

In the 1980s, more than 20 years after HDB flats were introduced, there were signs that segregation among the races had once again started to take root. Malay households made up more than 30 per cent of the estate population in Bedok and Tampines while the Chinese formed more than 90 per cent of the households in Hougang.  This was made worse by a growing resale market for HDB flats, where families tended to buy flats in areas with more residents of their own race.

Then Minister for National Development S. Dhanabalan warned that it would be “unthinkable” for Singapore to regress to the days before independence, when a certain place was seen as belonging to a certain ethnic or dialect group.

“Living in separate enclaves, the different races would find fewer opportunities to intermingle and understand each other. MPs and community leaders will develop narrow views of society interest. The enclaves will become the seedbeds for communal agitation,” he said at a New Year gathering for community leaders on 6 January 1989. 

Uprooting residents to break up the enclaves, like how it was done through a massive resettlement exercise in the 1960s, was not a viable option. People could still move to live close to others of the same race, as the reestablishment of enclaves at certain estates had shown. Hence, in 1989, the Ethnic Integration Policy was introduced.

Mr Dhanabalan, in introducing the policy to Parliament on 16 February 1989, called it a “open and clear policy”. The policy’s enforceable limits will ensure that the ethnic proportions are kept, which will prevent the races from “regrouping” even in the long run. 

The policy stipulated that the proportion of flats in each neighbourhood for Malays, Chinese, Indians and other minority groups would be 22 per cent, 84 per cent and 10 per cent respectively. The allowable proportion of flats in each block was set at 25 per cent for Malays, 87 per cent for Chinese and 13 per cent for Indians and other races.

## Case study: Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circle

After the arrest of 15 Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) members in Singapore in December 2001, there were jitters in the community. The Malay/Muslim community was worried that they would be discriminated against, while non-Muslims grew suspicious of their Muslim neighbours.

This growing distrust threatened to disrupt Singapore’s multiracial, multi-religious society, prompting then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong to promote open and public dialogues. He believed that the best way to address pockets of disquiet within society was for the community itself to take action.

“To strengthen race and religious relations, every community in Singapore must look within itself, and prevent developments that pull the community away from the larger Singapore society. We must also reach outside our own communities, and build bonds of confidence, friendship and trust with others,” he said, at one such dialogue with young Malay/Muslim professionals on 2 February 2002. 

Apart from encouraging every community to speak up against extremist voices, weed out deviant teachings and remove practices that reduce common space between the races, the government also formed Inter-Racial Confidence Circles, or IRCCs, in 2002.

They served as important bridges for leaders of the various racial and religious communities to interact through networking sessions and inter-faith dialogues and visits. 

Renamed Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles in 2007, IRCCs continue to act as peacekeepers. Besides promoting inter-faith interaction and understanding, they also respond quickly to racial and religious tensions by addressing ground concerns, quashing rumours and preserving solidarity among members.

IRCCs have also had to arbitrate on the use of common spaces by religious organisations like mosques or temples. One example was when a fire-walking festival used the common area outside a Hindu temple. The IRCCs were involved during the planning stages to find ways to minimise disruption to residents and businesses. 

Kembangan-Chai Chee IRCC chairman Fazlur Rahman noted that religious leaders already have sufficient platforms to communicate with each other. “What we need now are more ground-up initiatives where members of the community from various religious groups, especially the youth, come forward.” 

Indeed, 29-year-old librarian Joti Upadhya, who attended the National IRCC Convention 2018, said: “Usually we need to have events to discuss such issues (on race and religion). But we need to go beyond that. We should discuss them with our friends during lunches or gatherings.”

As Mr Goh said: “Each community does not exist in isolation, but as a member of the larger society. Its success and progress depend not only on its own efforts, but also on how well it gets along with the other communities, and how well we all manage to work together as a nation.”

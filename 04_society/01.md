# Our Fundamentals

**Beyond self-interest**
<br>For there to be peace and progress in a multi-racial, multi-religious and multi-cultural society like ours, Singaporeans need to go beyond our self-interest and look out for one another. Respect one another. Live in harmony together. Care for the young, the old, the ones with disabilities. It means forming a just, equal and inclusive society where everyone, regardless of background, can seek opportunities for a better life. Our strong economic growth and good urban environment would be meaningless if we faced constant conflicts and disorder in society.

**Beware of fault lines**  
We are a diverse people with different views, interests and instincts. We will always be at risk of clashing on old and new fault lines, facing challenges from internal and external influences. Our harmonious state of affairs can never be taken granted. It is a continuous work in progress.

**Be responsible citizens**
<br>Singapore was created through our own self-determination. As stakeholders of our nation, we are all responsible for the future of our country. We need to act as a cohesive society with a strong sense of citizenry, always finding the balance to serve the greater good.

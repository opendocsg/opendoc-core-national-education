<p>As Singapore progresses, new fault lines on issues such as class, immigration and LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) have emerged.</p>

<p>In a 2017 study on social capital in Singapore where 3,000 Singapore citizens and permanent residents were interviewed, the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) concluded that the sharpest social divisions may now be based on class, instead of race or religion. The study found that Singaporeans who live in public housing have fewer than one friend who lives in private housing, and that people who study in elite schools also tend to be less close to those in non-elite schools, and vice versa. It was also observed that while the respondents could easily name a friend of a different gender or age, and even race and religion, they were unable to name someone from another class.</p>

<p>This is supported by a report by the World Economic Forum released in January 2020, where Singapore was ranked 20th out of 82 countries surveyed on social mobility. Singapore performed poorly on fair wage distribution and social protection, ranking 51st and 61st respectively.</p>

<p>This is a problem for Singapore. Professor Tommy Koh, a veteran diplomat and special adviser to the IPS, said at a dialogue in 2018, that despite Singapore ranking among the top in terms of per-capita income, there are still many Singaporeans who live in poverty. His research estimates that 100,000 to 140,000 households lack the means to pay for their basic human needs. Poverty is very much a real issue in Singapore.
Singapore’s leaders have acknowledged this potential time bomb of social inequality among Singaporeans, and that something needs to be done.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/social-quotes-11-3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>PM Lee also spoke about the issue of inequality in a dialogue in 2018, noting that disgruntlement about this issue was not about coming from different backgrounds, rich or poor. On the contrary, the unhappiness arose if they were not given opportunities to work hard and improve their lives, and were instead stuck in a poverty cycle. Using the previous generation as an example, PM Lee said that they worked hard for a better living, and though it was tough, because they were given opportunities to improve their lives, they were still satisfied.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/social-quotes-12-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To enhance social mobility within Singapore, many government policies are targeted at creating a more inclusive society, with opportunities for all.</p>

<p>For example, steps have been taken to address the disproportionate number of students from more well-off families in brand-name schools. Since 2014, all primary schools are required to keep at least 40 places for children with no connections to the school. From 2019, one-fifth of places in affiliated secondary schools are set aside for students who do not benefit from affiliation priority.</p>

<p>Advancement in schools is also based on merit, using results from standardised national examinations. Tuition grants and financial aid are available to ensure education remains accessible to those in financial need. These policies help create a school environment where most students come from a mix of backgrounds and are given opportunities to mingle, regardless of socioeconomic status.</p>

<p>Many attempts have also been made to tear down the metaphorical fences between those living in public and private homes. For example, in June 1998, the People’s Association formed Neighbourhood Committees within private estates to promote active citizenry and neighbourliness, as what the Residents’ Committees in HDB zones do. Joint activities for both groups have been regularly organised since then.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/social-images-15-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Sports have been another rallying point, bringing people of various backgrounds together. Joining sports clubs at community centres is free, allowing avid players of the sport to mingle and get to know each other.</p>

<p>To ensure that no one is left behind, schemes such as SkillsFuture and the Progressive Wage Model provide opportunities for low-wage workers to upgrade their skills and take on more highly skilled work. In the case of SkillsFuture, the aim is to help Singaporeans develop and master relevant skills that will help them in their career. To ensure that all have the opportunity to access courses for self-improvement, credits are provided for Singaporeans aged 25 and above to use for courses. Subsidies are also provided for certain courses and after meeting certain requirements, such as an up to 90% subsidy on selected courses for Singaporeans aged 40 and above. This initiative helps to make training courses accessible to all, and help boost employability to achieve higher paying jobs, regardless of one’s starting point.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/social-images-12-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Those with disabilities are also given opportunities to improve their lives and contribute to society. A national road map – the Enabling Masterplan – was launched to improve the lives of the disabled and support their caregivers. The first masterplan was unveiled in 2007; the second in 2012. The third, launched in 2019, saw the creation of two new workgroups to help people with special needs live independently and improve their chances of getting a job. One group will look at making it easier to access lifelong learning opportunities and employment pathways, while the second will assess how technology and design in homes and the community help those with special needs live independently.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/social-images-13-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Total funding for special education schools have also risen by about 40 per cent over the last five years, ensuring that children and teenagers with intellectual difficulties are able to get an education. The number of special needs schools now stands at 19, with three more in the works. More mainstream schools are also opening their doors to students with mild special needs, with the help of allied educators. Currently, 20 per cent of students with special needs are in special education schools, with the rest, or 26,000 students, in mainstream schools. This figure has doubled from 13,000 in 2013.</p>

<p>While the government’s social provisions have broadened, they remain anchored in the basic principles of self-reliance, individual effort and personal responsibility. As former DPM Tharman famously told a BBC presenter on 7 May 2015, who had pressed him on the concept of a safety net: “I believe in the notion of a trampoline.” Social assistance in Singapore is not supposed to provide for a comfortable life but is meant to spur citizens on to get back on their feet.</p>

<p>Relying on government support alone is also insufficient, and it is up to the individual to take initiative and put in the hard work. PM Lee in his 2012 National Day Rally speech noted that there a need to “maintain a sense of mutual responsibility amongst ourselves and especially on the part of those who are more successful than others”.</p>

<p>Many Singaporeans have indeed come forward to help one another, and in recent years, there has been an upward trend in volunteerism in Singapore, especially among retirees. Charities like Temasek Foundation and Lien Foundation have also stepped up. Temasek Foundation has funded initiatives that include offering mothers from vulnerable families a community health and social care support system from pregnancy until their child is three, and empowering children from low-income families to chase their dreams in dance and art. Meanwhile Lien Foundation has been investing in the eldercare sector, creating more centres for seniors to exercise, undergo health checks or socialise, as well as more quality nursing homes equipped with facilities such as a gym and cafe.</p>

<h3 id="acts-of-care">Acts of Care</h3>
<p>The trend in volunteering is heartening to see. With potential fault lines and divisions in our society, it is important that we take active steps to build bridges and care for one another. Singaporeans may often be seen as cold and tend to keep to ourselves, but many times when push comes to shove and when it matters, we step up.</p>

<p>In March 2003, a deadly then-unknown virus made its way from Hong Kong to Singapore via a Singaporean former flight attendant. Within a month, the virus – later named the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) – spread to over 100 people on the island, killing four. There was widespread fear in dealing with the deadly disease. Alarm and panic soon turned into discrimination against healthcare workers.</p>

<p>Taxis and buses refused to stop at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), the designated screening and treatment centre for SARS. Neighbours did not want to ride the lift with nurses. Queues at food courts would quickly shorten when a nurse joined the line. After hearing about these incidents at a dialogue with TTSH staff, Dr S. Balaji, then Minister of State for Health highlighted the issue to the media, who then made the public aware of these discriminatory, fearful practices.</p>

<p>There was an outpouring of tributes to healthcare workers on the SARS frontline, with some Singaporeans writing in to forums to condemn discriminatory behaviour towards them, while others sent food, drinks and bouquets to TTSH.</p>

<p>Singaporeans also expressed support for their work with initiatives such as the Peach Ribbon Campaign, in which members of the public wore peach satin ribbons to show appreciation for healthcare workers. Those who got the ribbons were encouraged to make a small donation to the Courage Fund, which was set up to provide relief to SARS victims and healthcare workers. In less than two months, the campaign raised $322,121 for the fund.</p>

<p>There are other examples where Singaporeans gladly helped others. In 2015, when the transboundary haze from Indonesia hit Singapore and the Pollutant Standard Index readings hit hazardous levels forcing schools to shut, local kindness movement “Stand Up For Singapore” started a fund-raising campaign called “I Will Be Your Shelter”. Their aim was to buy air purifiers and filters for the elderly and needy in the North Bridge Road area. The campaign raised over $6,000. Another Singaporean, Mr Cai Yinzhou, started the “3000 masks, 1 Singapore” project, where he distributed masks to the elderly and migrant workers, while a hardware store at Block 442, Clementi Avenue 3 was spotted bearing a sign in English and Chinese that read: “Free mask for children and senior citizens.”</p>

<p>Similarly in 2020, as the world fought to control and contain the Covid-19 pandemic, Singaporeans once again stepped up to help others. One Singaporean couple gave out 6,600 surgical masks for free when they saw how Singaporeans were scrambling to find masks. While another couple made their own alcohol-based hand sanitiser, sharing it with their neighbours by placing a bottle of it at their block’s lift.</p>

<p>Crises aside, Singaporeans also have the capacity to show love to those struggling in their daily lives. One couple even opened their home to young people in need, quitting their jobs in the process. Mr Kenneth Thong and his wife, Adeline, started The Last Resort, running it out of a rented Seletar four-storey terraced house. The young adults who stay with them could be unwed mothers, homeless teenagers or those with mental problems. Most are from dysfunctional families and have nowhere else to go, and many are too old for institutional care or fostering. “We want them to experience what a normal, safe, functional family looks like. And that means they are free to have whatever we have here,” said Mr Thong in an interview with The Straits Times in 2018.</p>

<p>While there are many of these heartwarming examples, fostering a caring and inclusive society still requires constant nurturing, and getting people to look beyond the boundaries of their class lines.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>In Singapore, there are many opportunities to interact with one another regardless of background, whether in schools, workplaces, community organisations or neighbourhoods. However, building a caring and inclusive society boils down to a society of people with the heart and desire to take action and help one other at all times, from the efforts of one person to a joined effort by many.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/social-quotes-14.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>From providing equal rights to people of all races and religions, to forging a national identity that brings Singaporeans together, and building a society that is inclusive and caring, the journey towards a Singapore that will stay united against all odds is one that is still in progress and one that is up to Singaporeans to achieve.</p>

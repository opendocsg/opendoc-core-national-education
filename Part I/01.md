# Water Agreement (1962)

**Water Price Dispute (Source: Straits Times)**

Singapore and Malaysia inked legally-binding, long-term agreements in 1961 and 1962, to allow the Republic to draw raw water from Johor and for PUB to supply treated water back to the state. These pacts were enshrined in the 1965 Separation Agreement and registered with the United Nations. They contain provisions that make it clear Malaysia cannot unilaterally raise the price of water any time it wants. Water became a contentious issue during Tun Mahathir Mohamadâ€™s earlier term as Malaysian prime minister.

# Part I: Defence and Security

## Water Agreement (1962)

1\. Imperatives for Singapore’s defence and homefront security.  Singapore separated from Malaysia on 9 August 1965. During this period, the Cold War dominated the global geo-political landscape. Within the region, we faced a communist threat and Indonesian Konfrontasi. On the homefront, we experienced the communist-inspired Hock Lee Bus riots in the mid-1950s, and the communalist-based Maria Hertogh riots in 1950 and Sino-Malay riots in 1964.

Singapore and Malaysia inked legally-binding, long-term agreements in 1961 and 1962, to allow the Republic to draw raw water from Johor and for PUB to supply treated water back to the state. These pacts were enshrined in the 1965 Separation Agreement and registered with the United Nations. They contain provisions that make it clear Malaysia cannot unilaterally raise the price of water any time it wants. Water became a contentious issue during Tun Mahathir Mohamad’s earlier term as Malaysian prime minister.

## Konfrontasi (1963 - 1966)

2\. In the first two years of our independence, we had no defence to speak of. The Malaysians tried to show us that they were still in charge of our army. This brought home the realisation that being a sovereign country without the ability to defend ourselves was meaningless. Building up our own defence and homefront security forces, the SAF and the Home Team, became our top priority, hastened by the impending British withdrawal in 1971. 

Indonesia started the low-intensity conflict known as Konfrontasi under the leadership of President Sukarno, from 1963 to 1966 in opposition of the formation of the Federation of Malaysia which was established on 16 September 1963, comprising Malaya, Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak. During the conflict, Indonesia carried out more than 40 bomb attacks in Singapore. Amongst these, the MacDonald House bombing on 10 March 1965 was the most serious incident in Singapore.

In 1959, Singapore achieved self-governance after years of struggle. The People’s Action Party was voted into power in the Legislative Assembly general election, becoming the first full elected government of the self-governing state of Singapore on 5th June 1959. Mr Lee Kuan Yew was appointed as the state’s first prime minister.


## 1959-1965: Early Economic Strategies

The new government faced huge problems almost immediately. While Singapore had recovered from the devastation of World War II, the country was hardly in fit shape: the city centre was overcrowded, buildings were deteriorating, and nearly 70 per cent of the population lived in slums. Moreover, the economy was largely trade-based. As there was hardly any local industry to create meaningful jobs for a growing population, unemployment rate was in the double digits.

The economy became a key priority for the new government. The founding leaders of Singapore had in place two key economic strategies. One, rapid industrialisation, and two, merger with Malaysia.

**1961: A Plan for Rapid Industralisation**

In 1961, a team of United Nations (UN) economists led by Dutch industrialist Albert Winsemius visited Singapore to advise the new government how to develop its economy. They issued a report, “A Proposed Industrialisation Programme for the State of Singapore”, which outlined a plan to embark Singapore on a path of rapid industralisation to absorb the large numbers of unemployed workers.

They recommended that in order to end unemployment, over 200,000 jobs had to be created within 10 years. Until that time, the local economy was dominated by trading firms and entrepot trade. While trade formed the basis of Singapore’s prosperity during the colonial period, it left Singapore’s economy particularly vulnerable to the global prices of tin and rubber. Furthermore, entrepot trade was not able to generate enough jobs to absorb the rising numbers of unemployed workers. 

The lead agency tasked to undertake the critical role of implementing the industrialisation plan was the Economic Development Board (EDB), which was set up in 1961. Taking over from the Singapore Industrial Promotion Board, which was founded in 1957, EDB had a much larger remit and capital base. It was armed with $100 million over the period of 1961 to 1964 to drive industrialisation in Singapore. Its first task was to build the necessary infrastructure to support the plan.

One of its first tasks was to develop Jurong into an industrial estate, as part of a push to create labour-intensive industries that would generate jobs for the people. Some of the early factories produced items such as garments, toys and wigs. This was only the beginning of the story of Jurong.

**1963: Merger with Malaysia**

The economic rationale for a merger with Malaysia was clear. A combined market of about 12 million people was big enough to immediately overcome the limitations of Singapore's small market size by enabling the growth of local firms, and generating jobs and income for Singaporeans. 

However, this was complicated on several fronts. 

First, the strong presence of communism throughout the 1960s engendered a high level of industrial unrest in Singapore. 

	In 1961, the left-wing arm of the ruling People’s Action Party broke off to form the Barisan Sosialis, whose objective was to topple the government. As part of their strategy, the communists instigated workers to wreak havoc on the economy. From 1963 to 1968, Singapore lost some 35,000 to 45,000 man-hours each year to strikes. 

This was severely disruptive to the economy, making Singapore unattractive to foreign investors. “The running joke was that a factory would be set up on Monday and all sorts of banners screaming ‘Exploitation of Workers’ would be hung up by Friday,” shared Mr I.F. Tang, who was part of the UN team of experts. 

Furthermore, in 1963, the newly formed Federation of Malaya came under Indonesia’s attack. Back then, Indonesia believed that the Federation was created to contain its influence in the region. As such, it embarked on [Konfrontasi](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/126b6b07-f796-4b4c-b658-938001e3213e), a low-intensity confrontation between Indonesia and the Federation. 

	Led by President Sukarno, Indonesia carried out acts of subversion and sabotage, including bombings, to destabilise the Federation between 1963 and 1966. 
	
	Moreover, it cut trade ties with the Federation, hoping to disrupt its trade and cripple its economy. As a result, Singapore’s trade with Indonesia shrank. Imports fell by 23 per cent while exports declined 31 per cent in 1964 compared with 1963. 
	
	The Indonesians also carried out a series of bombing attempts in Singapore, both to directly cause damage to Singapore as well as rattle foreign investors. On 16th November 1964, an attempt by 10 Indonesian commandos to sabotage an oil installation was foiled. The next year, in 1965, the tragic bombing of Macdonald House along Orchard Road claimed the lives of three, while injuring another 33.

In addition, the union with Malaysia was also troubled from the start. 

	Both sets of leaders – Malaysia’s Tunku Abdul Rahman and Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew – fundamentally disagreed on what kind of society they wanted. Mr Lee was insistent on a society where all races were treated equally but the Tunku believed in the primacy of the Malays in Malaysia. Tensions boiled over to the streets as racial violence exploded across the Federation. 

	On the economic front, the anticipated benefits from the merger did not quite pan out the way it was initially envisioned. The increase of the manufacturing share of real GDP was modest – from 16.9 percent in 1960 to 19.1 percent in 1965. Real GDP grew at an annual compound rate of 5.7 percent during this period. Some 21,000 jobs were created in manufacturing, but the unemployment percentage still hovered in the double digits. This persuaded Dr Goh that the benefits of the common market were not as substantial as he once believed.

The political, social and economic difficulties of the merger led to a momentous decision, one that defined Singapore’s story. Cast out of Malaysia on 9th August, 1965, Singapore was on its own -- it no longer had a common market of 12 million consumers to support its growth. With no natural resources, a tiny population and rising unemployment, Singapore’s leaders were faced with a dire situation.

## 1965-1970: Singapore’s Development Plan

The exit from Malaysia thrust Singapore into the open. Without a hinterland nor natural resources, the challenges facing the new nation were immense. Labour unrest continued to fester while unemployment remained high. The only solution was to press on with the plan to rapidly industrialise the economy.

Without Malaysia’s large market, Singapore’s leaders had to think out of the box. Instead of focusing on the domestic market, our leaders switched to an export-oriented strategy. Labour-intensive industries were created to soak up unemployment while pushing ahead with the building of infrastructure to serve the industries.

Singapore’s plans were, however, disrupted by a shock announcement. Just two years after independence, in 1967, the British announced that it would withdraw its forces from Singapore, dealing a huge blow to the newly independent nation. Not only would the withdrawal compromise the defence of Singapore’s sovereignty, it would also deeply impact Singapore’s economy.

The British withdrawal meant that Singapore had to accelerate its plans for an export-led industralisation strategy. This required Singapore to open our borders to foreign investors, a course of action that seemed to go against conventional wisdom at the time. While some newly independent nations were moving to eject foreign corporations from their borders, slashing imports and manufacturing their own products for the domestic market, this only worked because they had a large domestic market that Singapore did not have. 

**Gaining a Foothold in the Global Market**

To survive, Singapore had to tap on the global market. As then Finance Minister Goh Keng Swee explained:
![](/assets/Screenshot 2020-10-22 at 9.38.50 AM.png)
The economic rationale behind the courting of foreign investors was twofold:

1. First, large foreign companies targeted the global market, had the necessary expertise and networks that would allow Singapore to quickly scale up these industries. They also had the financial capital to invest in Singapore’s infrastructure. For instance, oil company Shell built Singapore’s first oil refinery at the cost of $30 million on Pulau Bukom in 1961.

2. Second, the goal was to eventually enable knowledge transfer from foreign companies to local enterprises. This would enable local companies to, in the long run, also acquire the necessary technical expertise to start building local industries.

Hence, pressing ahead with the export-oriented strategy, EDB shifted its focus to promoting Singapore as an attractive destination for foreign investment. 

EDB’s initial function of providing financing to companies was hived off to the newly set-up Development Bank of Singapore (DBS), while the function of developing and managing industrial infrastructure was given to the newly set-up Jurong Town Corporation (JTC). Its export promotion division was absorbed by Intraco, a government trading company. All three new agencies were created in 1968.

EDB’s officers fanned out to foreign markets that included the United States and Japan to persuade big companies such as Texas Instruments, Fairchild and Seiko to set up their production bases in Singapore. EDB made it a priority to attract these investments and went the extra mile to ensure that the foreign companies had what they needed. 

	In 1968, when National Semiconductor visited Singapore, EDB’s officers found out that there was an urgent need for the company to start production within two months. 
	
	EDB worked with other government agencies to ensure a quick start-up process. Within two weeks of the visit, National Semiconductor was in business here. The speed and efficiency of this operation drew the attention of other American manufacturers. Fairchild came soon after, followed by Texas Instruments, Hewlett-Packard and General Electric. 

To further boost Singapore’s attractiveness as an investment location, the government moved to create a conducive investment environment for foreign corporations. 

	In 1967, the Economic Expansion Incentives Act was introduced. It provided new tax incentives for investments. These included up to 90 per cent remission of tax profits to approved enterprises for up to 15 years, among other tax exemptions and relief. 

The government also continued to build infrastructure to support Singapore’s industrialisation efforts. 

	In 1964, the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) was created to take over the functions of Singapore Harbour Board, which were previously in charge of port operations. It also took over and converted the former British Naval Base Store Basin into Sembawang Wharves in 1971. 
	
	In 1965, as part of the Jurong industrialisation project, Jurong Port, which handled bulk cargo used by industries located in Jurong, was opened. 

	In 1968, the establishment of Neptune Orient Lines gave Singapore another way to support the economy through fair freight routes. 

Communication services such as postal, telegraph, telephone, and telex services also grew rapidly between 1966 and 1973.

**Focusing on Education and Training**

The efforts by the government to embark on vocational training in the early 1960s meant that by 1965, Singapore had a pool of semi-skilled workers who would support the nation’s growing industrialisation. This effort did not stop there, for it was one of the ways Singapore could continuously make itself relevant to large companies. 

As Dr Goh explained:

**Quelling Labour Unrest and Communism** 

Another key priority for the government was to stamp out the communist elements that were fomenting unrest and dissent.  Dr Winsemius described this as a top objective for the government:
![](/assets/Screenshot 2020-10-22 at 9.45.58 AM.png)
The National Trades Union Congress was founded in 1961, after the communist elements broke away from the PAP. Over the course of three years, NTUC battled with the communist-supported Singapore Association of Trade Unions for influence over workers. In 1968, the government amended the Industrial Relations Act, which was aimed at reducing the number of strikes in the economy.

*(Image: [NTUC](http://ms50.ntuc.org.sg/1960s/))*

The following year, in 1969, NTUC held the "Modernisation of the Labour Movement" seminar, a forum that looked to build on the new norm in industrial relations. In it, Mr Lee urged the unions to shed its image as purely as "a combat organisation... for class war,” and move towards acting in the interests of the nation. This formed the foundation of what would later be known as tripartism. 

```
Tripartism refers to the collaboration among unions, employers and the government. The goal is for the three parties to work together in a consultative and collaborative fashion to further shared interests. 

The National Wages Council, set up in 1972, is perhaps the best manifestation of tripartism. Its objective is to help bring employers, unions and the government to a consensus on wages, an issue that was traditionally damaging to labour relations. Since then, the NWC has been issuing yearly wage guidelines that take into account the interests of all three parties, ensuring compromise instead of confrontation. 

```

The number of strikes fell drastically. There were 10 strikes in 1972 and just one in 1977. From 1977 to 2012, Singapore experienced no strikes, a period of calm which also coincided with falling unemployment and rising foreign direct investment.

Today, tripartism is seen as a key competitive advantage for Singapore. It has been called Singapore’s “secret weapon”, helping to boost the country’s economic competitiveness, promoting harmonious labour-management relations and contributing to Singapore’s overall progress.

By 1970, about a decade after the industrialisation plan was first conceived, Singapore had achieved near full employment. Industrial action had dropped significantly. Instead of disruption, a spirit of cooperation took its place.

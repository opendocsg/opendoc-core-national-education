The rapid industrialisation drive in the 1960s was incredibly successful. 

Investment commitments between 1968 and 1973 amounted to more than $2.3 billion, mostly from the petroleum and electronics sectors. Real GDP grew at an impressive pace of 13 percent annually from 1966 to 1973. Manufacturing’s share of the economy also rose from 16.0 percent to 22.3 percent over the same period.

Employment in the manufacturing sector grew by more than 50 per cent between 1966 and 1969, from 51,272 to about 87,128. Unemployment rate dropped from 8.9 percent in 1966 to 4.5 percent in 1973. Thousands of Singaporeans enjoyed good jobs and better pay. The surge in wealth was accompanied by a corresponding rise in living standards.  

**Facing and Tackling a New Problem: Labour Shortage **

The push to develop labour-intensive industries was so effective that by the 1970s, labour surplus turned into a labour shortage. 

With a limited supply of manpower, labour costs started to rise. At the same time, countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia were just firing up their industralisation plans. With large pools of labour, they posed direct competition to Singapore. 
Thus, tackling the labour shortage problem became a consistent theme throughout the 1970s. 

In order to keep growing, Singapore had to adjust its economic strategy away from labour-intensive industries and into higher-value goods. This would ensure that Singapore’s workers continue to see a flow of jobs and income. 

In 1973, then Finance Minister Mr Hon Sui Sen announced a two-pronged approach to tackle the labour shortage in Singapore. One, attract new foreign investment in higher-value manufacturing, such as petrochemicals and precision engineering. Two, to upgrade and upskill workers across the economy in a bid to raise productivity.

	1. To attract new higher-value industries to Singapore, the government provided tax incentives for targeted industries. One higher-value industry that grew rapidly during this period was the oil and petrochemical industry. The oil industry has been in Singapore since the late 19th century, functioning as a regional distribution centre for kerosene. It was only in the 1960s that oil majors started to invest big in Singapore. Between 1961 and 1973, four refineries were built and commissioned. 

	In his 1974 Budget statement, Minister Hon said that the economic upgrading strategy had started to pay off, noting that total investment commitments in manufacturing jumped from $336 million in 1972 to $819 million in 1973, led by higher technology industries, such as petroleum and petrochemical products. By the late 1970s, Singapore had became one of the largest refining centres in the world, with a capacity of more than 1.2 million barrels a day.

	2. Investing in the people was another important aspect of growing the economy. In his speech to Parliament in 1970, Dr Goh Keng Swee said that there was an urgent need to tackle a looming skills gap, one that was going to hurt the economy by the mid-1970s. The economy needed engineers, highly skilled technicians and business management graduates to continue powering its growth.

	The result was a concerted effort to boost human resources, starting with the strengthening of the education system. The government also focused on raising the productivity of workers, as part of overall efforts to overcome the small workforce disadvantage. While this was part of the economic plan as early as in the 1960s, the productivity policy was formally launched in the 1970s. This culminated in Singapore’s first national productivity campaign, launched by Foreign Minister S. Rajaratnam in 1975. 

The economy performed well in the 1970s, with real GDP growing an average of 9.2 per cent between 1970 and 1980. With a strong manufacturing base and an increasingly educated workforce, the basic building blocks of Singapore’s modern city-state economy were put in place. 

## 1979 to 1984: Economic Restructuring

By the late 1970s, there were more capital-intensive industries that were set up in Singapore. Using incentives to attract foreign investors and companies was working but the pace was not quick enough. 

**1979: Three-Year Corrective Wage Poliy:** 

In order to accelerate the economic restructuring programme, the National Wages Council (NWC) adopted a three-year corrective wage policy in 1979. This consisted of strong wage increases as well as hikes in the CPF contribution rates to reflect the full employment state of Singapore’s economy.

The efforts paid off, as companies quickly began adopting higher-value work. At the same time,  companies producing lower-value products moved to cheaper offshore locations. Net investments between 1980 and 1984 averaged $1.7 billion a year, led by an expansion in high value-added industries such as computers, electronics, machinery and pharmaceutical products.

**Investing in Infrastructure** 

At the same time, we continued make bold investments in upgrading our infrastructure to facilitate and improve international connectivity. 

As a small city state, we are heavily dependent on international aviation links to the rest of the world. That was why Singapore’s leaders took an early interest in the development of Singapore’s aviation links and airports. In 1966, just a year after independence, Singapore became a member of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), a body under the United Nations. 

	Founding PM Mr Lee Kuan Yew also advocated moving the airport from Paya Lebar to Changi in the 1970s. This went against the advice of foreign experts who had suggested building a second runway at Paya Lebar instead. The decision would mean writing off some $800 million that had been spent on Paya Lebar with another $1.5 billion to be spent on developing the airport in Changi. 

	Despite the challenges, Mr Lee believed that it was the right decision. For one thing, building the airport near the sea would provide the space needed to grow its capacity for future needs. An airport near the sea would also reduce the noise pollution on residents, with the aircraft flying into Singapore over the sea. Singapore went ahead to build Changi Airport.

	By the time Changi Airport was opened in 1981, it had already racked up a list of achievements.  It was ranked then as Asia’s largest airport, alongside Tokyo’s Narita Airport. It also had the world’s largest column-free hangar, spanning 20,000 sq m. It was also completed in just six years, a time frame that many experts called record-breaking.

	More importantly, the airport was a symbol of Singapore’s ambitions and showcased our drive and efficiency. The move allowed Changi Airport to continuously grow its capacity and upgrade its facilities. Indeed, by 1990, just nine years later, a second terminal was opened. By 1991, Changi Airport was handling more than 15.1 million passengers a year, nearly double the 8.1 million passengers when it was first opened. 

By the end of the restructuring period, Singapore had succeeded in attracting high-value, capital intensive industries and companies. 

However, the restructuring came with a cost: the corrective wage policy coupled with the slump in global demand caused Singapore to enter into its first recession in 1985.

## 1986 to 1996: Rebounding into a Decade of Growth

![](/assets/Screenshot 2020-10-19 at 11.41.29 AM.png)

The 1985 recession was a painful but important reminder that the country could not afford to stand still. The growth we saw prior to the recession was flagging, as resource constraints and the diminishing returns of investment had started to kick in. Change was necessary. 

The challenge for our economy were clear: could restructure the economy in order to capture new opportunities while staying ahead of the competition which was emerging from other fast-industrialising economies such as Malaysia, South Korea and Taiwan? 

Change came in the form of new directions and creating different engines of growth. One was to diversify Singapore’s economy by developing multiple areas of growth. Another was to expand our presence overseas. These efforts fortified resilience in the economy and created buffers to mitigate future downturns. We took on the challenge and emerged stronger than before. 

**Growing the Financial Sector**
 
One key niche area that had become increasingly important to Singapore was its financial sector. 

While local banks such as OCBC, UOB and OUB have been stalwarts, their main business prior to independence was supporting Chinese merchants and traders. Once industralisation took off, however, these banks, including DBS, became full commercial banks that financed a wider array of financial activities. 

In the late 1960s, the development of the Asian Dollar Market helped establish Singapore as a leading foreign exchange market after London New York and Tokyo. 

By the 1980s, financial services had become one of the biggest drivers of economic growth. In 1983, for instance, the financial sector alone accounted for about 30 percent of overall GDP growth. 

The 1980s and 1990s also saw Singapore intensify efforts to develop fee-based financial activities such as fund management, stock trading activities and insurance. 

**Growing the Tourism Sector**

![](/assets/Screenshot 2020-10-19 at 11.43.17 AM.png)

Another area that was given much focus in the 1980s was tourism. 

In 1981, the government identified the tourism industry as one of the pillars of growth in its 10-year economic development plan. In 1984, a tourism task force headed by then Minister of State for Trade and Industry Wong Kwei Cheong was convened to look at revitalising and promoting Singapore as a major tourist destination. 

The task force recommended developing new tourism attractions such as a new indoor stadium that could host concerts and conventions. 

It also called for the government to preserve historical areas such as Chinatown, places full of rich historical and cultural tradition. 


**Strengthening the Manufacturing Sector**

![](/assets/Screenshot 2020-10-19 at 11.44.05 AM.png)

At the same time, The government also continued the multi-year drive to upgrade our industries and move up the value chain. 

In manufacturing, we moved to further deepen our expertise in high-value manufacturing including production, testing and assembly. 

	For instance, we built on Singapore’s expertise in electronics and precision engineering. This helped Singapore benefit greatly from the growth of personal computing. 
	
	From 1986 to 1996, Singapore produced about 45 to 50 percent of the world’s hard disks, making Singapore a critical global node for hard-disc drives. 

Moreover, to ensure that we did not become over-reliant on electronics, we also diversified within the manufacturing sector. 

The government embarked on an ambitious plan to develop a petrochemicals facility that would entrench Singapore as a global petrochemicals hub. Jurong Island is a man-made island that combined the best of Singapore – forward thinking, a dare-to-do-and-dream attitude as well as the ability to deliver the final product.

**Developing an External Wing**

Up till the 1990s, the focus had been to bring in foreign investment to build up Singapore’s economy. Outward investment from Singapore to overseas market was not a key concern. 

It was clear, however, it should not remain that way. 

	The 1986 Economic Committee Report noted that investment returns within the country started to face diminishing returns. Moving some investment overseas to growing economies would bring in better returns. It also suggested that Singapore could make more use of its accumulated experience in building and operating airports and sea ports, as well as urban planning to help other industrialising countries develop. In this way, Singapore could start to move exports beyond goods and into services.

Moreover, there was also a need to groom Singapore’s own crop of home-grown companies. These companies would anchor and base their operations in Singapore and expand overseas in regional markets to develop scale and market share.  

![](/assets/Screenshot 2020-10-19 at 11.45.59 AM.png)

These considerations led the government to embark on a concerted push to develop an external wing of its economy. 

This period saw huge investments from Singapore flow into China and neighbouring countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia. In China, we started our first government-to-government project, the Suzhou Industrial Park, and later Tianjin Eco-City. In Indonesia, Singapore companies helped to set up Batamindo Industrial Park and the Bintan Industrial Estate. 

As Singapore expanded its export of goods and services, we became increasingly dependent on free trade. There is a need to ensure that we have access to open markets. As such, we have always supported an open, rules-based multilateral system that promotes a stable and predictable international trading environment such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO). 

![](/assets/Screenshot 2020-10-19 at 11.46.49 AM.png)

Keeping free trade flowing to Singapore was a key reason behind the drive to develop a network of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), the first of which – the ASEAN Free Trade Area– was inked in 1992. 

	As at 2020, Singapore has 23 FTAs, ranging from bilateral agreements with economies such as Japan, Costa Rica, China and the United States, to regional pacts such as the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership and Singapore-European Free Trade Association FTA. 

	The primary goal of such FTAs is to “expand Singapore’s economic space”, wrote Ambassador-at-large Tommy Koh in 2019.

	“The strategy was to link our small economy to the economies of other bigger countries. In this way, Singapore will be more deeply connected to the global supply chain and our exporters will have lower tariff or non-tariff barriers.”

	These FTAs enable Singapore’s exporters, which include foreign manufacturers based here, to enjoy preferential rates in key export markets such as China, Japan and the US. This gives Singapore an edge over other lower-cost locations and is another reason foreign MNCs are keen to invest in Singapore.

Between 1986 and 1996, Singapore grew at an average of 12.8 per cent a year, launching Singapore into a group of fast-growing nations that analysts termed Asian Tigers. Singapore alongside Taiwan, Korea and Hong Kong, were hailed for their remarkable growth over the decade. 

One key success factor that the ability to constantly make Singapore relevant to the global economy. Without a large domestic market or natural resources, there is no real need for large companies to invest in us. Neither would large countries want to trade with a tiny island that had little to offer in return.

## 1997 to 2009: Overcoming Multiple Crises

In 1997, the [Asian Financial Crisis](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/87709dd7-72ae-47e2-876c-60544bb25e00) swept the region, toppling governments and bankrupting companies, governments and individuals. Singapore was also affected, sinking into a deep recession in 1998. Thousands of Singaporeans lost their jobs, as companies folded under the poor economic conditions. 

It was the first of many crises that marked this 12-year period, one of the most difficult in Singapore’s short history as an independent nation. Soon after the Asian Financial Crisis, Singapore was buffeted by [SARS](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1529_2009-06-03.html) in 2003 which deeply impacted travel in the region. The world was then confronted with the [Global Financial Crisis](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/3cacf256-82cc-4776-b7f8-83757723b502) in 2008. 

Fortunately, we were able to weather these crises well, largely due to our strong reserves and prudent fiscal policy.

	Singapore’s Constitution states that the government’s budget must be balanced over its term of office. This means that the government of the day cannot spend beyond its means. Over the years, the government has been regularly recording surpluses that it saves as reserves. Past reserves cannot be spent without the approval of the Elected President. This ensures fiscal sustainability and prevents irresponsible spending. These reserves have, in turn, been invested to generate returns.

	The reserves acts as a buffer against external shocks as it did in 1997. Even though Singapore was not spared from the financial contagion, we were much less affected than our neighbouring countries.  Similarly, Singapore was able to draw on its reserves during one of the worst global financial crises since the Great Depression in 1929. The Great Financial Crisis in 2008 saw the collapse of some of the biggest banks and threatened to tip the world over into another depression. Governments rallied to prevent the catastrophe, spending trillions in the process. Singapore’s government also took major steps to prevent the economic meltdown. In 2009, Singapore tapped its reserves for the first time in its history to fund the $4.2 billion Jobs Credit and Special Risk-Sharing Initiative. Both schemes, aimed at saving jobs and supporting businesses, were part of a bigger $20.5 billion Resilience Package. The measures worked – in 2010, Singapore’s economy grew 10 per cent, among the fastest in the world. The strong economic recovery allowed the government to later return the $4 billion to the reserves.

	The strong reserves also give the government additional spending power to plan for Singapore’s future. In recent years, the laws have been tweaked to allow the government to draw on the returns from the reserves to fund its budget under the Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) framework. 

This sustainable approach to budgeting has had multiple benefits. 

The returns generated over the years have been used by the government for its spending. For instance, between FY2015 and FY 2020, the NIRC supplied the government with about $90 billion of additional funds. Examples of large-ticket items that have been directly or indirectly funded by the returns include the Pioneer Generation Package, upgrading of transport infrastructure and the rise in social spending. 

The government has also regularly distributed the surpluses to Singaporeans so the wider population can share in the country’s growing wealth.

The reserves were built by a country that had no natural resources, but through discipline and the hard work of its people, noted Mr Heng:

## 2010 to the Present: New Challenges

The challenges Singapore has and continues to face since 2010 are manifold: some are structural in nature while others require shorter-term tactics. 

Here are some of the present challenges and how we will be going about tackling them in the years ahead.

**A Mature Phase of Growth**

![](/assets/Screenshot 2020-10-19 at 11.48.42 AM.png)


By 2011, it was clear that Singapore had entered the next phase of its economic development: the mature stage. It would be difficult for us to grow at previous rates and growing at between 3 percent and 5 percent a year would a good result. 

One reason for this is simply our finite resources: as a small country, we have limited land and people. While we were able to circumvent our physical limits through innovations such as the Jurong Rock Caverns, the reality is that we cannot expect to keep growing at the same pace. 

**Ageing Population**


![](/assets/silver-age-photo-2.jpg)
*Image: Population.sg*

Apart from having to deal with the geographical limitations and small population, our ageing population is one of the most daunting challenges that Singapore faces.

	The life expectancy in Singapore has risen to 83.2 years, in 2018 from 76.1 years in 1990. By 2030, one in four Singaporeans will be aged 65 and above. Likewise, between 2011 and 2030, the median age of the citizen population will rise from 39 years to 47 years.

	Efforts to boost the natural rate of population growth has had little success - total fertility rate stood at just 1.14 per Singaporean woman in 2018, much lower than the replacement rate of 2.1.

The ageing population will have a significant impact on Singapore’s economy in the long term. 

As older workers leave the workforce without a sufficient pool of younger workers to replace them,  the economy could also start to lose its dynamism and vibrancy. Talent is a critical component for companies in the knowledge-based economy but with a shrinking workforce, companies could struggle to find the talent they need here. This would make Singapore far less attractive than its neighbours, which have younger population bases.

The ageing workforce also puts strains on other parts of the Singapore economy, especially its fiscal position. Income tax collections could start to decline with a smaller workforce, which would then constrain the government’s ability to spend. At the same time, there will be a need to raise social spending. In fact, social spending has already doubled from $15 billion in 2009 to $30 billion in 2018, with further rises expected as the population continues to age.

**Rise in Populism and Anti-Trade/Globalisation Forces**

![](/assets/Screenshot 2020-10-19 at 11.49.58 AM.png)

When Britain first voted to leave the European Union in 2016, many analysts thought it was a one-off event that concerned only the British. What many did not expect was that is was the start of a surge in populism around the world.

The rise of populism goes beyond simply embracing nationalism; nativist tendencies result in the wholesale rejection of globalisation and all that open borders bring. 

	One of the biggest fallouts from this trend has been the ongoing US-China trade tensions. In 2018 and 2019, the world’s two largest economies started to levy tariffs worth hundreds of billions of dollars on each other. That in turn has severely affected the global trade and economy. 

	The rising tensions have also spilled over into the technological arena, with the US banning American companies from using technology from Chinese company Huawei. The US and China signed a pact to ease trade tensions in early 2020 but the episode serves as an important reminder of how quickly a shift in the external environment can hit Singapore hard.

The rise of protectionism results in the reduction of trade, which affects Singapore’s livelihood directly. Should trade barriers go up, Singapore’s exports will start to get more expensive and less competitive. A secondary impact is through slower growth rates for both countries. A reduction in trade is likely to lead to slower growth. This, in turn, will likely lead to falling demand for Singapore’s exports. 

The longer-term impact of rising populism is on the fate of multilateral organisations such as the UN, WTO and the International Monetary Fund – will they stay relevant? 

For instance, the US has already pulled out of the Paris Agreement unilaterally, threatening to overturn progress made so far in the landmark climate change pact. Likewise, the WTO, which is the primary forum for countries to resolve trade conflicts, has been under siege. 

This puts Singapore in a difficult spot, since small countries typically rely on such organisations and international law to resolve conflicts with larger powers. 

As PM Lee said, multilateral organisations such as the UN and WTO are critical to Singapore’s survival:

**Digital Disruption: A Source of Challenges and Opportunities**

![](/assets/aisingapore.jpg)

Digital technology has reshaped the way we work, live and play. Whether it is Facebook and how it is changed our social circle, or how Grab has redefined the taxi industry, technological disruption is on the rise. 

The advent of technologies such as artificial intelligence, 3D printing and robotics is revolutionising manufacturing, while big data has given companies new ways to understand their consumers. This in turn is quickly changing the rules of the game for companies. If they are armed with the right idea, capital and networks, small companies can quickly scale up to displace large and slower incumbents. 

This offers a range of new challenges and opportunities for Singapore for Singapore. 

On the one hand, digital technologies have the potential to make quantum leaps on productivity, generating billions in additional economic value. However, digital disruption, if not managed well, could lead to social issues. 

	For instance, the rise of robots has led some to believe that there could be huge job losses. Large companies which employ thousands of people could find themselves disrupted quickly if they do not move fast enough. 
	
	Workers could also find themselves out of a job if they hold on to obsolete skills. New types of workers, including those from the gig economy have risen. 

The challenge for governments around the world, including Singapore, is managing these challenges while positioning the economy to benefit from these forms of digital disruption.

### External Challenges: New Competition from Regional Rivals


![](/assets/changiairportterminal.jpg)
*(Image: Gov.sg)*

Singapore remains one of the top destinations for investment largely because it has kept its status as a key transport, financial, maritime and technology hub. However, major cities around the region are challenging Singapore in various fields.

	Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur are aiming to be the regional hubs for air travel. The governments of both countries have spent massively to upgrade existing airport infrastructure. This is partly why we have had to be forward-looking in order to stay ahead of the competition.

	China’s Belt and Road Initiative will see billions of dollars being poured into the region to build infrastructure, from roads to ports. While stronger connectivity helps keep lines of communication open, some of these ports and airports could rise to become our competitors along the way.

Likewise on the financial front, Singapore may have a significant lead over neighbouring countries as a financial hub but competition is quickly hotting up. 

The Singapore Exchange has seen trading volumes – an indicator of how strong the stock exchange is – fall over the years, compared to stock markets in Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines. As these emerging economies mature, they will continue to attract more investor attention.

### External Challenges: COVID-19

The COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) pandemic had forced governments to close their borders, halt economic activity, and make people stay at home. With the global economy coming to a partial standstill, Singapore was deeply affected. 

Flash estimates by the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed that the Singapore economy had contracted 2.2 per cent, setting the country on course for its worst recession since independence.

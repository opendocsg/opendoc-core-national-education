# Staying Exceptional

*6 minute read*

**Keeping the Fundamentals Intact**
 
There are no easy solutions to many of these problems. But one thing is clear: in an increasingly fragmented world, Singapore must remain stable, safe and attractive to foreign investment and relevant to the world.

## Staying Open

As Singapore is a small and open economy, we must keep championing and pushing for free trade and access to open markets.

To this end, we will continue to look for like-minded partners who also believe in the need for free trade whether in goods, services or even digital trade. We are pushing for regional cooperation across multiple platforms, from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership to the Asean Economic Community. These agreements will help to ensure that we continue to have access to overseas markets, a factor that is critical to Singapore’s survival.

Apart from building international linkages, we have been forging closer ties within the region. ASEAN remains an important market for us, given our strong ties with our neighbours and the rest of the ASEAN countries.

## Upgrading our Workers' Skills

The rise of the digital economy has led to a surge in demand for specific skills such as software engineering, data science and artificial intelligence programming. But much of the population has not yet caught up, leading to a skills gap.

Singapore’s approach to the problem has not deviated from Dr Goh’s philosophy back in the early days of industrialisation, which is primarily to welcome foreign talent with the right skills that companies need. 

This approach has worked to bring in some of the best talent in technology to support the growing needs of both big tech companies and fast-growing startups here. In 2019, a report by the US-based Startup Genome said that Singapore ranked second for startup talent, just behind Toronto-Waterloo but ahead of Silicon Valley. This has been a key success factor in building Singapore’s reputation as a startup hub for Asia.

But the long-term solution remains grooming world-class talent from within. 

Apart from equipping students with technological skills, we also need to continue retraining and reskilling our adult workers for the new economy. We are doing this through SkillsFuture, a national movement that aims to promote a culture of lifelong learning. This is especially important as the rapid pace of change means that getting one form of qualification or one set of skills is no longer enough.  

## Transforming our Industries

Today’s global economy is marked by accelerating pace of change, with shorter business cycles and rapid digital disruption. This makes it imperative for Singapore, being a small and open economy, to continuously reinvent itself to keep up with the environment. 

Companies in Singapore face both opportunities and challenges in the new digital economy. E-commerce, for instance, opens up new markets while slashing costs for both big and small companies.

To help companies transform, Singapore has rolled out Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) for 23 sectors covering 80 per cent of the economy. 

	ITMs aim to transform companies at a sectoral level. These maps are modelled on each industry’s specific needs, targeting companies which need help to transform in order to meet the needs of the new economy. 
	
	For instance, manufacturing companies that use robotics or automation can seek grants from the government. These technologies may be too expensive for small companies to acquire but grants are aimed at helping companies adopt technological solutions to boost productivity and achieve scale. 
	
	Business associations are partnering the government and the unions to carry out the work the ITMs rolled out so far. 

## Strengthening Tripartism

Tripartism remains important to Singapore’s success. Harmonious relations were the bedrock on which Singapore’s early industrialisation efforts were based. While industrial disruption is no longer an issue, technological disruption has brought about new and complex challenges. 

Tackling such difficult issues, including how to provide for the retirement adequacy of gig economy workers and ensuring Singaporeans remain employable in the midst of an AI and robotics revolution, requires workers, employers and the government to work well together.

But there are threats to this strong bond of trust built up over decades of working together. Digital disruption could lead workers to distrust the rise of technology, especially if it threatens their jobs. This could lead to a breakdown of trust between employees and companies, leading to friction and the loss of the powerful tripartite relationship.

Strengthening this bond remains a critical strategy for Singapore. A strong tripartite bond is resilient to shocks that could threaten Singapore’s economic and social fabric.

In his May Day 2019 rally speech, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat noted that many workers in advanced economies are frustrated with stagnant wages, falling standards of living and a malfunctioning political system. Avoiding this requires companies, the government and workers to pursue inclusive growth.

“We cannot guarantee the same will not happen here. But we can and must try to avoid a similar fate. And the key to that is tripartism and the continued vitality of our unions,” he said.

## Staying Nimble and Adaptable to Change

The government has played a central role in building and growing the economy. 

In its 2017 report, the Committee on the Future Economy stressed that it cannot tell the future, but it knows what Singapore will need to succeed:

This approach is making a difference.

For instance, the government has been testing autonomous vehicles in parts of Singapore, with the aim of rolling them out for public use. 

Another example is agriculture. The introduction of new technology in agri-technology such as tower farming and the use of AI-controlled environmental lighting have helped push new frontiers in the sector.

**Conclusion**

In the 2011 book Hard Truths, founding PM Lee Kuan Yew was asked what it will take for Singapore to survive, given the rising challenges that Singapore face. 

His advice was simple, clear and straightforward:

Indeed, the story of Singapore’s journey from third world to first was a journey marked by sacrifice, determination and willpower. It is a story about how a people built something from nothing; how a nation’s fate that was determined by guts and gumption; and how the will of a people determined to survive managed to succeed against the odds.

It is with the knowledge of this past that we can be confident of the future. The world will continue to evolve, and change will continue to accelerate. For this, we must prepare for a world that is vastly different from what it is today. Will Singapore succeed in the next 50 years as it has in the past 50 years? Nothing is guaranteed. But as long as the country keeps to its fundamentals, and stays pragmatic and resilient, there is no reason we cannot continue to thrive.

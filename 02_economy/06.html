<h2 id="british-military-withdrawal-from-crisis-to-catalyst-for-growth">British Military Withdrawal: From Crisis to Catalyst for Growth</h2>

<p><em>2 minute read</em></p>

<p><img src="/assets/Screenshot 2020-10-19 at 11.21.54 AM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In 1967, the British government released a White Paper announcing the withdrawal of its military forces in the Far East, including Singapore and Malaysia. The weakened British economy could no longer support the estimated £70 million a year in maintaining a military presence overseas.</p>

<p>The British withdrawal had significant impact on Singapore on several fronts.</p>

<p>The first was on the security of the country. Singapore had just started to build our defence force but it would take many years to build a credible military to defend the country from hostile powers.</p>

<p>But more immediate and urgent was the impact on Singapore’s fragile economy. The military accounted for about 20 per cent of the economy and more than 30,000 jobs. The Singapore government estimated that the British military spent about $450 million in 1966 alone.</p>

<p>When it became clear that the British had no intention of changing their minds – they in fact accelerated the withdrawal of the military from the mid-1970s to the end of 1971– the Singapore government acted swiftly to deal with the challenge.</p>

<p><strong>Converting Military Bases for Civilian Use</strong></p>

<p>First, the Singapore government formed the Bases Economic Conversion Department (BECD), whose objective was to manage the handover of the bases from the British to Singapore.</p>

<p>Led by Mr Hon Sui Sen, the first chairman of the Economic Development Board, the BECD focused on converting the military bases, which occupied some 15,000 acres or 11 per cent of Singapore’s land, to commercial use.</p>

<p>The converted bases aided the creation or expansion of several major industries in the early 1970s. These included the conversion of the naval dockyard at Sembawang into a commercial shipyard, turning Changi airbase into a recreational resort and later an international airport, and converting Blakang Mati into a tourist resort, which they renamed Sentosa. These would later aid in the development of the various sectors of the economy, from ship building and tourism to manufacturing.</p>

<em>(Image: Map of Blakang Mati dated 1895. Up to the 1960s, it was part of a British military base, sparsely populated by barracks and a few kampongs; <a href="https://www.nas.gov.sg/1stCab/PanelPDF/Section%203%20-%20Economy%20Miracle%2019.pdf">NAS</a>)</em></p>

<p><strong>Retraining Workers</strong></p>

<p>The BECD was also responsible for the retraining of affected workers. With aid from the British, the department moved to train hundreds of retrenched workers in technical skills that were sorely needed by the growing economy. Thousands of workers also joined civilian shipyards, using their skills to build and repair civilian ships instead of military ones. Others were moved to support growing sectors such as the manufacturing sector.</p>

<p>Through sheer will and adaptability, Singapore managed to turn its first crisis into a major catalyst for growth.</p>

<p>As historian Loh Kah Seng noted in 2011, “the accelerated British withdrawal was not only the final chapter of decolonisation in Singapore, but also the first step in the independent city-state’s growth”.</p>

<p>Littered with villages and crocodile-infested rivers, Jurong used to be nothing more than swampland. That is until Singapore’s then Finance Minister Goh Keng Swee mooted the idea of turning Jurong into the centre of Singapore’s early industrialisation plans.</p>

<p>It was a risky plan given that Singapore had little experience in creating an industrial town of this size. According to the late Mr Sim Kee Boon, a former Permanent Secretary who had helmed various ministries during his career, Dr Goh himself admitted that the Jurong project was “an act of faith and he himself jokingly said that this could prove to be Goh’s folly”. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/pm-lky-with-edb-chairman-surveying-what-was-to-become-the-jurong-industrial-estate.jpg" alt="" />
<em>(Image: Then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew with EDB Chairman surveying what was to become the Jurong Industrial Estate; National Archives of Singapore via <a href="https://www.roots.gov.sg/learn/stories/jurong-industrial-estate/story">Roots.sg</a>)</em></p>

<p>EDB was tasked to transform Jurong into a hub of factories and industrial activities, a responsibility that was later devolved to Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) which was set up as a separate agency in 1968.</p>

<p>The project involved developing a 9,000 acre piece of land in Jurong, a complex task that involved land reclamation, resettling villagers and building infrastructure such as roads, power lines and water supply.</p>

<p>By the time the industrial estate was ready to be launched in 1963, foreign investors were still unsure about Singapore and Jurong. However, with tax incentives and a persuasive group of EDB officers, investors started to trickle in. The first company to set up a factory was the <a href="https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2018-11-20_105235.html">National Iron and Steel Mills</a> in 1964, and Jurong never looked back.</p>

<p>Over the next few years, Jurong would become the centrepiece of Singapore’s early industrialisation efforts, a bustling hub of factories and workers. Within three years, by the end of 1967, Jurong Industrial Estate had attracted investments worth a total of about $178 million in fixed assets and generated jobs for some 6,500 workers.</p>

<p>More than just a collection of factories, Dr Goh saw Jurong as an entire town, with amenities to boot. He commented that “life in Jurong cannot be other than spartan”.</p>

<p>JTC also oversaw the construction of recreational facilities, a town centre and housing flats to cater to the growing population in Jurong Town. Over the years, these extended to include the Jurong Bird Park, Chinese Garden, Japanese Garden and Jurong Park, among others. Roads, stadiums and hospitals were also constructed.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Screenshot 2020-10-28 at 2.30.18 PM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Today, the future of Jurong remains bright. The 360ha Jurong Lake District has been earmarked to be Singapore’s second central business district (CBD). Development plans include a commercial precinct, housing and expanded gardens.</p>

<p><em>2 minute read</em></p>

<p>After enjoying uninterrupted growth for nearly 20 years, Singapore faced its first recession in 1985, an episode which tested the country’s resolve in managing crises.</p>

<p>The factors that contributed to the sharp decline in economic activity were varied. For one, the patchy external global economy was a key factor. Dragged by a slowdown in the US, demand for Singapore’s exports fell sharply.</p>

<p>Singapore’s economy was also grappling with several cyclical and structural problems.</p>

<p>One key factor was the slump in construction. In the late 1970s to the early 1980s, Singapore went through a major construction boom, contributing almost a third of economic growth during the period. This was unsustainable and when the boom ended, the economy dived.</p>

<p>A deeper problem lay in the structural make-up of the economy – while the wage correction policy helped hasten Singapore’s move up the value chain, the acceleration of rising costs also caused Singapore to lose competitiveness.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Screenshot 2020-10-28 at 2.52.43 PM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The government quickly sprang into action. In March 1985, then Minister for Trade and Industry Mr Tony Tan formed the Economic Committee. Helmed by then Minister of State for Defence and Trade and Industry Mr Lee Hsien Loong, the committee was tasked to study the recession and what Singapore could do to recover from it. Titled “The Singapore Economy: New Directions”, the report, published in 1986, listed several policy reforms.</p>

<p>The first issue was to tackle production costs, in particular labour costs. The committee recommended slashing the Central Provident Fund (CPF) contribution by 15 per cent, with temporary wage restraints put in place as well. Corporate tax was also reduced by 7 percent. The committee also recommended cutting corporate and income taxes and for companies to embark on wage reform to introduce flexibility in wages.</p>

<p>By 1987, Singapore‘s growth rate leapt to 10.8 percent, kicking off a period of strong growth that would last well into the 1990s.</p>

<p>For the longer-term outlook, the committee said Singapore should continue with moving up the value chain. It also suggested looking at developing and exporting services, and moving beyond functioning as an offshore production base. At the same time, Singapore should continue to develop itself into a conducive environment for businesses to thrive. This included having competitive taxes and a strong regulatory regime to strengthen the corporate sector.</p>

<p>The ability to beat off the recession was the product of a decisive government and a people willing to take a bitter pill for long-term gain, said then Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew in 1986:</p>

<p>Formed from seven smaller islands, Jurong Island was borne out of a vision that Singapore could be a leading global petrochemicals player despite its size. The idea to develop the southern islands came as early as the 1980s. But it was only in the 1990s that Singapore moved to realise this dream of creating an island dedicated to the production of specialty chemicals.</p>

<p>A big part of the reason for building Jurong Island was because of the pressing need to diversify away from electronics manufacturing, which had become a key export for Singapore. Petrochemicals was a good fit for Singapore as Singapore had already established itself as a major oil refining hub in the region.</p>

<p>The idea to build a man-made island came from former EDB chairman Philip Yeo. His plan: to build an integrated facility that would anchor the various types of petrochemical companies in Singapore.</p>

<p>JTC and EDB worked together with other government agencies to develop the island. In 1991, JTC was appointed the agent of the Jurong Island project. JTC planned and worked with other agencies to provide infrastructure and services to the island, including land reclamation, roads and utilities. EDB officers went on an aggressive investment promotion drive to sell the idea to foreign petrochemical companies.</p>

<p>Jurong Island cost the government an estimated $7 billion but it has more than paid back its investment. Since it opened, it has attracted over $50 billion worth of investments, with more than 100 companies employing some 26,000 people. It is a symbol of Singapore’s efficiency, boldness and innovation, traits that will keep Singapore’s economy going.</p>

<p><em>3 minute read</em></p>

<p>The late 1990s was a tough period for the Singapore economy. It was still reeling from the Asian Financial Crisis which had swept over the region, disrupted economies and bankrupted hundreds of large companies. The global outlook was looking grim. Free trade talks had taken a hit with the World Trade Organisation’s Doha Talks stalling.</p>

<p>Faced with dim prospects, Singapore decided that it would chart its own economic future by pushing for free trade agreements with its key trading partners, said former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong in 2014.</p>

<p>Singapore had an ambitious plan to signal its intention: seal an FTA with the world’s largest economy, the United States.</p>

<p>In order to get any deal done, then US President Bill Clinton had to give his approval, but Singapore’s relationship with the White House was at a low point at the time.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Singapore had angered some parts of the US government because it had sentenced American teenager Michael Fay to six strokes of the cane for vandalism and theft, a case that gained international media attention. 

The US government pressured Singapore for clemency for Fay but the Singapore government stood its ground, arguing that Singaporeans would also be given the same sentence if found guilty of the same crime. 

Nonetheless, then President Ong Teng Cheong reduced the number of strokes from six to four out of respect to President Clinton. Many US lawmakers criticised the decision and, as a result, the White House refused to let PM Goh meet with President Clinton. 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Instead of forcing his way into the White House, PM Goh decided to go through the informal way – via a game of golf.</p>

<p>Through a mutual friend, President Clinton, who is a keen golfer, learnt about PM Goh’s passion for golf. When the opportunity presented itself in 1997 during an APEC Leaders’ meeting in Vancouver, both leaders played a game of golf. That set the stage for further discussions, which took place again on the green some three years later at another APEC Leaders’ meeting in 2000 in Brunei.</p>

<p>Following the end of the banquet in Brunei, PM Goh approached President Clinton to ask if he would be up for a game of golf. President Clinton said yes.</p>

<p>They played a game of 18 holes. After which, PM Goh made his pitch:

Officially signed in 2003 and implemented a year later, the US-Singapore FTA was the first FTA signed between the US and East Asia. The FTA removes tariffs and allows for better movement of goods between the two nations.</p>

<p>The FTA was a powerful signal to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>It showed that despite its size, Singapore could persuade the world’s biggest economy to ink a deal on free trade. As a result, the FTA set an important precedent for future FTAs to be negotiated.</p>

<h2 id="asean-economic-community-forging-closer-ties">ASEAN Economic Community: Forging Closer Ties</h2>

<p>Southeast Asia is home to some of the fastest-growing economies in the world and is poised to become the fourth-largest economy by 2030. And the region’s prospects can burn even brighter once it achieves economic integration and a single common market, a goal that began in 2003.</p>

<p>The outlook in the early 2000s for global free trade looked poor. The World Trade Organization (WTO) was not able to move ahead with plans to liberalise trade. Countries such as the European Union and the United States sought to create their own bilateral deals, bypassing WTO altogether.</p>

<p>It was during this period that then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong mooted the idea of a single market for ASEAN. He called it the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), “a single production base and a single market, with free movement of goods, services and capital. This is the only way to make sure we remain competitive in the face of growing regional and bilateral FTAs, post-Cancun”.</p>

<p>By liberalising trade, the region’s GDP could increase by “at least 10 per cent”, and reduce operational costs by “up to 20 per cent”. This would translate to a U$50 billion boon to Asean’s GDP.</p>

<p>It was not until 2007 that the first AEC blueprint was drawn up, and the declaration for it signed. The first phase of the plan was to move towards closer integration by 2015, with intermittent checkpoints along the way.</p>

<p>One of its key aims was for the region to eliminate most intra-regional tariffs and remove formal restrictions in the services sector; simplify cross-border trading process and develop a more attractive investment business-friendly environment, by adopting common frameworks and standards.</p>

<p>In the seven-year period that followed, trade in ASEAN grew by U$1 trillion. Singapore’s businesses were also now able to tap on the 600 million consumers in the region.</p>

<p>Building on the first phase, the next lap of economic integration is expected to be complete by 2025, with the eventual goal of establishing ASEAN as a single market, with the free flow of trade and investment among the 10 member states. It will prepare the region for new areas such as e-commerce, and liberate the region further with the removal of non-tariff barriers.</p>

<p>The AEC goes beyond promoting free trade amongst regional economies. As a bloc, the AEC will have tremendous influence when dealing with other big trading partners such as China and Europe. It will also attract large amounts of investments, with investors eager to be part of the exciting growth story.</p>

<p>More importantly, closer integration will anchor stability within the region and promote cooperation among member states. For Singapore, this is an invaluable part of its foreign trade efforts and will keep Singapore as an attractive location for companies looking to expand into the region.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/singapore_the_next_great_place_for_urban_agriculture_01.jpg" alt="" />
<em>(Image: <a href="https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/blog/agritech/singapore-the-next-great-place-for-urban-agriculture?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=Indoor+Ag-Con+2019">Enterprise Singapore)</a></em></p>

<p>In the 1960s, farmland occupied 14,000 hectares of land in Singapore, but by 1988, that number was just 2,037 hectares. Today, Singapore’s 5.7 million citizens rely largely on imported food, with just 10 per cent of what they eat being sourced locally.</p>

<p>While this means that Singapore has access to the global market of different types of food, it also exposes Singapore to the “volatilities of the global food market”, said Minister for Environment and Resources Masagos Zulkifli.</p>

<p>It was with this in mind that Singapore launched the “30 by 30” plan in 2019, a drive to ensure that the country can produce 30 per cent of the food it consumes annually by 2030.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5E1NIwRx9d4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>This may seem daunting given that Singapore does not have large tracts of land to support farming activities. The development of agri-technology is an example of how Singapore can continue to defy its physical limitations.</p>

<p>One early example was the Lim Chu Kang Agrotechnology Park, situated in an area once well-known for its vast plantations. Phase One was built in 1989, and one company there was able to cultivate temperate vegetables like lettuce in the tropical climate, a world’s first. The model was replicated in places like Mandai, Nee Soon and Sungei Tengah in phases over time.</p>

<p>Another example was the Marine Aquaculture Centre (MAC), opened in 2003. The centre led to the development of a new breed of sea bass which has a shorter incubation time and is more resistant to diseases. Half a million of these fishes were hatched at St. John’s Island, nurtured in Indonesia, and sent back to Singapore in a successful pilot test.</p>

<p>The latest agri-food push came in the form of a new 18-hectare site in Sungei Kadut in 2019. The Agri-Food Innovation Park at Sungei Kadut will bring together high-tech farming and R&amp;D activities, including indoor plant factories, insect farms and animal feed production facilities. Enterprise Singapore also announced that it is co-investing up to $90 million in agri-tech start-ups.</p>

<p>Beyond simply ensuring Singapore’s food security, these efforts are also spawning fresh economic activity, as Singapore positions itself to take a big bite of the global $5 trillion agri-technology pie.</p>
